## üóÇÔ∏è Chat with PDFs - Using LangChain and RAG

### Overview

This project allows users to interact with the contents of multiple PDFs through a chat interface. By leveraging the LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, the application can answer questions based on the information within the uploaded PDFs.

### Key Features

- Upload multiple PDFs and create a searchable database of their contents.
- Use a large language model to answer questions based on relevant sections of the PDFs.
- Display the thought process of each agent involved in the automation process.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- PyPDF2
- LangChain
- OpenAI API
- Hugging Face Hub

### Setup

To set up and run the application, follow the instructions in the project's [README](Chat-with-PDFs/README.md).

## üì∞ Newsletter Generator App Using CrewAI

### Overview

This project automates the generation of newsletters using a team of autonomous agents built with CrewAI. The GUI allows users to input a topic and personal message, and then displays the process of generating a newsletter, which can be downloaded as an HTML file.

### Key Features

- Automated generation of newsletters based on user-provided topics.
- Display the process of agents finding, summarizing, and formatting content.
- Download the generated newsletter in HTML format.

### Technologies Used
