## üóÇÔ∏è Chat with PDFs - Using LangChain and RAG

### Overview

This project allows users to interact with the contents of multiple PDFs through a chat interface. By leveraging the LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, the application can answer questions based on the information within the uploaded PDFs.

### Key Features

- Upload multiple PDFs and create a searchable database of their contents.
- Use a large language model to answer questions based on relevant sections of the PDFs.
- Display the thought process of each agent involved in the automation process.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- PyPDF2
- LangChain
- OpenAI API
- Hugging Face Hub

### Setup

To set up and run the application, follow the instructions in the project's [README](https://github.com/Dhruv-NNT/Generative-AI-and-NLP-Projects/tree/main/Chat%20with%20PDFs%20-%20Using%20LangChain%20and%20RAG).
