Apple's new development in AI aims to take on OpenAI's GPT products and may make your interactions with virtual assistants like Siri more intuitive.

The ReaLM system, which stands for ""Reference Resolution As Language Modeling,"" understands ambiguous on-screen images and content and conversational context to enable more natural interactions with AI.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The new Apple system outperforms other large language models like GPT-4 when determining context and what linguistic expressions refer to, according to the researchers who created it. And, as a less complex system than other Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT series, researchers called ReaLM ""an ideal choice"" for a context-deciphering system ""that can exist on-device without compromising on performance.""

For example, let's say you ask Siri to show you a list of local pharmacies. Upon being presented with the list, you might ask it to ""Call the one on Rainbow Road"" or ""Call the bottom one."" With ReaLM, instead of getting an error message asking for more information, Siri could decipher the context needed to follow through with such a task better than GPT-4 can, according to the Apple researchers who created the system.

""Human speech typically contains ambiguous references such as 'they' or 'that,' whose meaning is obvious (to other humans) given the context,"" the researchers wrote about ReaLM's abilities. ""Being able to understand context, including references like these, is essential for a conversational assistant that aims to allow a user to naturally communicate their requirements to an agent, or to have a conversation with it.""

The ReaLM system can interpret images embedded in text, which the researchers say can be used to extract information like phone numbers or recipes from on-page images.

OpenAI's GPT-3.5 accepts only text input, and GPT-4, which can also contextualize images, is a large system trained mostly on natural, real-world images, not screenshots — which the Apple researchers say hinders its practical performance and makes ReaLM the better option for understanding on-screen information.

""Apple has long been seen as a laggard to Microsoft, Google, and Amazon in developing conversational AI,"" The Information reported. ""The iPhone maker has a reputation for being a careful, deliberate developer of new products — a tactic that's worked well to gain the trust of consumers but may come to hurt it in the fast-paced AI race.""

But with the teasing of ReaLM's capabilities, it appears Apple may be getting ready to enter the race in earnest.

The researchers behind ReaLM and representatives for OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

It remains unclear when or whether ReaLM will be implemented into Siri or other Apple products, but CEO Tim Cook said during a recent earnings call that the company is ""excited to share details of our ongoing work in AI later this year.""","Read previewApple's new development in AI aims to take on OpenAI's GPT products and may make your interactions with virtual assistants like Siri more intuitive.

4/3/2024 11:20,AAPL,Globe Echo,Key Developer Leaves Apple for Rival Browser Company,"In addition to the push for AI integration in browsers, Apple is also facing challenges in the European Union due to its restriction on developers using Apple’s Webkit rendering engine on iPhones and iPads. The European Union’s Digital Markets Act has called out this practice, raising concerns about competition and user choice. This means that any significant changes to the iPhone browser experience will have to focus on the interface rather than the rendering engine.

The announcement of integrating AI into the Arc Browser is a key part of The Browser Company’s vision for the future of web browsing. With the tagline “the browser that browses for you,” the company aims to redefine the way users interact with the internet. This shift in thinking about the browsing experience involves a deep consideration of interface design, which Deets will play a crucial role in developing. The use of AI in the browser will go beyond a simple reskinning of the WebKit engine and offer users a personalized and efficient browsing experience.

As The Browser Company prepares to launch its AI-powered Arc Browser, the industry is watching closely to see how much of an impact AI can have on the browsing experience. With Apple expected to showcase their own AI developments at the upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference, the competition in the browser market is heating up. The adoption of AI by Safari and other browsers will be a key factor in determining the success of AI integration in the browsing industry. The Browser Company is poised to lead the way with its innovative approach to AI in browsers.

In a landscape where the web browser is a critical part of any operating system, changes in how browsers function have the potential to impact millions of users worldwide. The hiring announcement by The Browser Company signals a shift towards a more AI-driven browsing experience, setting the stage for a new era in internet browsing. By bringing in top talent like Charlie Deets, the company is making a clear statement about its commitment to innovation and user-centric design.

4/3/2024 11:20,AAPL,Benzinga,'Please Don't Talk To Her' — Apple Called Out By Jon Stewart For Blocking FTC Chair Lina Khan's Interview - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),"Loading... Loading...

Apple Inc. AAPL is alleged to have prevented Jon Stewart, former “Daily Show” host, from hosting a podcast episode with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairwoman Lina Khan. This comes amid ongoing antitrust investigations into Apple’s business practices and market monopoly.

What Happened: Stewart revealed that Apple had blocked him from interviewing FTC Chair Khan on his podcast, “The Problem With Jon Stewart”. The podcast is an offshoot of his AppleTV show that shares the same name.

During a segment on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show, ” Stewart said to Khan, “Apple asked us not to do it. They literally said, ‘please don't talk to her.'”

This development reportedly follows a recent lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against Apple. The lawsuit accuses the tech giant of monopolizing the smartphone market in violation of antitrust laws. The lawsuit also highlights Apple’s growing influence in the TV and movie production industry, which allows it to control content.

Reacting to these allegations, Apple defended its business strategies, expressing that the lawsuit “threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.” Apple insists that a successful lawsuit would impede its ability to deliver the technology customers anticipate.

Why It Matters: The alleged incident indicates the growing tension between tech giants and regulatory bodies. Notably, Stewart has been vocal in criticizing prominent figures in the tech industry. Khan, the FTC Chairwoman, is renowned for her stringent views on antitrust matters. Under her leadership, the FTC has initiated scrutiny of several tech giants, including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia.

In a previous episode of ""The Daily Show,"" he satirically called out individuals such as Mark Zuckerberg, Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, and Satya Nadella for their lofty promises regarding AI potential. The recent incident adds another chapter to the ongoing narrative of big tech’s struggle with antitrust issues.

Apple Inc. AAPL is alleged to have prevented Jon Stewart, former “Daily Show” host, from hosting a podcast episode with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairwoman Lina Khan. This comes amid ongoing antitrust investigations into Apple’s business practices and market monopoly.

What Happened: Stewart revealed that Apple had blocked him from interviewing FTC Chair Khan on his podcast, “The Problem With Jon Stewart”. The podcast is an offshoot of his AppleTV show that shares the same name.

During a segment on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show, ” Stewart said to Khan, “Apple asked us not to do it. They literally said, ‘please don't talk to her.'”

This development reportedly follows a recent lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against Apple. The lawsuit accuses the tech giant of monopolizing the smartphone market in violation of antitrust laws. The lawsuit also highlights Apple’s growing influence in the TV and movie production industry, which allows it to control content.

Reacting to these allegations, Apple defended its business strategies, expressing that the lawsuit “threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.” Apple insists that a successful lawsuit would impede its ability to deliver the technology customers anticipate.

Why It Matters: The alleged incident indicates the growing tension between tech giants and regulatory bodies. Notably, Stewart has been vocal in criticizing prominent figures in the tech industry. Khan, the FTC Chairwoman, is renowned for her stringent views on antitrust matters. Under her leadership, the FTC has initiated scrutiny of several tech giants, including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia.

In a previous episode of ""The Daily Show,"" he satirically called out individuals such as Mark Zuckerberg, Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, and Satya Nadella for their lofty promises regarding AI potential. The recent incident adds another chapter to the ongoing narrative of big tech’s struggle with antitrust issues.

4/3/2024 14:20,AAPL,Defense World,"Apple (AAPL) Stock Price, News & Analysis","Apple Inc. is among the world's most iconic brands. Founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, it is now the leading producer of consumer electronics and an economy all of its own. The was valued at over $2.6 trillion in 2022 and brought in $0.4 trillion in revenue making it equal in size to the economies of Thailand and Belgium which are ranked 24th and 23rd largest worldwide.

Founders Jobs and Wozniak, both college dropouts, founded the company with the idea of changing the way people looked at computers. Their vision coincided with a revolution within the PC industry and helped to create personal computing as we know it today. The company’s first product was a personal computer known as the Apple 1 but the product line has since evolved to include a wide range of desirable personal computing devices.

Tim Cook took over the role of CEO in 2011 shortly before the death of Steve Jobs. Cook joined the company in 1988 as Senior VP of Global Sales and went on to become Executive VP of Global Operations before taking on the chief executive role. In his tenure, Mr. Cook has more than doubled Apple’s revenue and earnings while growing the company’s value by more than 450%.

The company designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories worldwide. Apple also provides and sells related platforms and services to power them and is the host of a widely-used digital ecosystem. The digital ecosystem revolves around the Apple App Store which lists thousands of games and applications for iOS users. The App Store also features digital content like music, TV, and movies as well as books, podcasts, and other forms of digital content.

Apple is headquartered in Apple Park, an ultra-modern campus built in Cupertino, California. The campus features a massive circular building nicknamed The Spaceship and provides working space for over 12,000 employees. The circular shape houses a park and a pond and there are many amenities within the facility including cafes, a wellness center, care clinics, and terminals for the shuttle system.

The company’s core product line has shifted away from computers over the years and towards iPhones and devices but computing is still fundamental to the business. In regard to iPhones, Apple’s products are routinely ranked as the top-selling in all comparisons. Other product lines include Mac (a line of computers), iPad (a line of tablets), AirPods (wifi-enabled earbuds), wearables like the Watch, home accessories such as Apple TV, and smart-home devices like the HomePod.

Finally, Apple provides AppleCare support services, cloud store services, and a host of other service offerings intended to simplify life. Among them are Apple News (subscription news), Apple TV+ (subscription TV with original content), Apple Card (consumer credit card), and Apple Pay (mobile cashless pay feature).

Apple computers and wifi-enabled smart devices are in demand by consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, the education sector, enterprises, and governments worldwide because they are high-quality, long-lasting, powerful devices.

Apple's new development in AI aims to take on OpenAI's GPT products and may make your interactions with virtual assistants like Siri more intuitive.

The ReaLM system, which stands for ""Reference Resolution As Language Modeling,"" understands ambiguous on-screen images and content and conversational context to enable more natural interactions with AI.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The new Apple system outperforms other large language models like GPT-4 when determining context and what linguistic expressions refer to, according to the researchers who created it. And, as a less complex system than other Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT series, researchers called ReaLM ""an ideal choice"" for a context-deciphering system ""that can exist on-device without compromising on performance.""

Related stories

For example, let's say you ask Siri to show you a list of local pharmacies. Upon being presented with the list, you might ask it to ""Call the one on Rainbow Road"" or ""Call the bottom one."" With ReaLM, instead of getting an error message asking for more information, Siri could decipher the context needed to follow through with such a task better than GPT-4 can, according to the Apple researchers who created the system.

""Human speech typically contains ambiguous references such as 'they' or 'that,' whose meaning is obvious (to other humans) given the context,"" the researchers wrote about ReaLM's abilities. ""Being able to understand context, including references like these, is essential for a conversational assistant that aims to allow a user to naturally communicate their requirements to an agent, or to have a conversation with it.""

The ReaLM system can interpret images embedded in text, which the researchers say can be used to extract information like phone numbers or recipes from on-page images.

OpenAI's GPT-3.5 accepts only text input, and GPT-4, which can also contextualize images, is a large system trained mostly on natural, real-world images, not screenshots — which the Apple researchers say hinders its practical performance and makes ReaLM the better option for understanding on-screen information.

""Apple has long been seen as a laggard to Microsoft, Google, and Amazon in developing conversational AI,"" The Information reported. ""The iPhone maker has a reputation for being a careful, deliberate developer of new products — a tactic that's worked well to gain the trust of consumers but may come to hurt it in the fast-paced AI race.""

But with the teasing of ReaLM's capabilities, it appears Apple may be getting ready to enter the race in earnest.

The researchers behind ReaLM and representatives for OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

It remains unclear when or whether ReaLM will be implemented into Siri or other Apple products, but CEO Tim Cook said during a recent earnings call that the company is ""excited to share details of our ongoing work in AI later this year.""","Read previewApple's new development in AI aims to take on OpenAI's GPT products and may make your interactions with virtual assistants like Siri more intuitive.

4/3/2024 14:20,AAPL,Defense World,"Apple (AAPL) Stock Price, News & Analysis","Apple Inc. is among the world's most iconic brands. Founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, it is now the leading producer of consumer electronics and an economy all of its own. The was valued at over $2.6 trillion in 2022 and brought in $0.4 trillion in revenue making it equal in size to the economies of Thailand and Belgium which are ranked 24th and 23rd largest worldwide.

Founders Jobs and Wozniak, both college dropouts, founded the company with the idea of changing the way people looked at computers. Their vision coincided with a revolution within the PC industry and helped to create personal computing as we know it today. The company’s first product was a personal computer known as the Apple 1 but the product line has since evolved to include a wide range of desirable personal computing devices.

Tim Cook took over the role of CEO in 2011 shortly before the death of Steve Jobs. Cook joined the company in 1988 as Senior VP of Global Sales and went on to become Executive VP of Global Operations before taking on the chief executive role. In his tenure, Mr. Cook has more than doubled Apple’s revenue and earnings while growing the company’s value by more than 450%.

The company designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories worldwide. Apple also provides and sells related platforms and services to power them and is the host of a widely-used digital ecosystem. The digital ecosystem revolves around the Apple App Store which lists thousands of games and applications for iOS users. The App Store also features digital content like music, TV, and movies as well as books, podcasts, and other forms of digital content.

Apple is headquartered in Apple Park, an ultra-modern campus built in Cupertino, California. The campus features a massive circular building nicknamed The Spaceship and provides working space for over 12,000 employees. The circular shape houses a park and a pond and there are many amenities within the facility including cafes, a wellness center, care clinics, and terminals for the shuttle system.

The company’s core product line has shifted away from computers over the years and towards iPhones and devices but computing is still fundamental to the business. In regard to iPhones, Apple’s products are routinely ranked as the top-selling in all comparisons. Other product lines include Mac (a line of computers), iPad (a line of tablets), AirPods (wifi-enabled earbuds), wearables like the Watch, home accessories such as Apple TV, and smart-home devices like the HomePod.

Finally, Apple provides AppleCare support services, cloud store services, and a host of other service offerings intended to simplify life. Among them are Apple News (subscription news), Apple TV+ (subscription TV with original content), Apple Card (consumer credit card), and Apple Pay (mobile cashless pay feature).

Apple computers and wifi-enabled smart devices are in demand by consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, the education sector, enterprises, and governments worldwide because they are high-quality, long-lasting, powerful devices. The company sells its products through an omnichannel network of DTC, wholesales, and eCommerce channels including mobile carriers, retailers, and resellers.","The company’s first product was a personal computer known as the Apple 1 but the product line has since evolved to include a wide range of desirable personal computing devices.

Apple's new development in AI aims to take on OpenAI's GPT products and may make your interactions with virtual assistants like Siri more intuitive.

The ReaLM system, which stands for ""Reference Resolution As Language Modeling,"" understands ambiguous on-screen images and content and conversational context to enable more natural interactions with AI.

The new Apple system outperforms other large language models like GPT-4 when determining context and what linguistic expressions refer to, according to the researchers who created it. And, as a less complex system than other Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT series, researchers called ReaLM ""an ideal choice"" for a context-deciphering system ""that can exist on-device without compromising on performance.""

For example, let's say you ask Siri to show you a list of local pharmacies. Upon being presented with the list, you might ask it to ""Call the one on Rainbow Road"" or ""Call the bottom one."" With ReaLM, instead of getting an error message asking for more information, Siri could decipher the context needed to follow through with such a task better than GPT-4 can, according to the Apple researchers who created the system.

""Human speech typically contains ambiguous references such as 'they' or 'that,' whose meaning is obvious (to other humans) given the context,"" the researchers wrote about ReaLM's abilities. ""Being able to understand context, including references like these, is essential for a conversational assistant that aims to allow a user to naturally communicate their requirements to an agent, or to have a conversation with it.""

The ReaLM system can interpret images embedded in text, which the researchers say can be used to extract information like phone numbers or recipes from on-page images.

OpenAI's GPT-3.5 accepts only text input, and GPT-4, which can also contextualize images, is a large system trained mostly on natural, real-world images, not screenshots — which the Apple researchers say hinders its practical performance and makes ReaLM the better option for understanding on-screen information.

""Apple has long been seen as a laggard to Microsoft, Google, and Amazon in developing conversational AI,"" The Information reported. ""The iPhone maker has a reputation for being a careful, deliberate developer of new products — a tactic that's worked well to gain the trust of consumers but may come to hurt it in the fast-paced AI race.""

But with the teasing of ReaLM's capabilities, it appears Apple may be getting ready to enter the race in earnest.

The researchers behind ReaLM and representatives for OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

It remains unclear when or whether ReaLM will be implemented into Siri or other Apple products, but CEO Tim Cook said during a recent earnings call that the company is ""excited to share details of our ongoing work in AI later this year.""","Apple researchers developed a new AI system to ""see"" and interpret context from on-screen content.

4/3/2024 11:20,AAPL,Globe Echo,Key Developer Leaves Apple for Rival Browser Company,"In addition to the push for AI integration in browsers, Apple is also facing challenges in the European Union due to its restriction on developers using Apple’s Webkit rendering engine on iPhones and iPads. The European Union’s Digital Markets Act has called out this practice, raising concerns about competition and user choice. This means that any significant changes to the iPhone browser experience will have to focus on the interface rather than the rendering engine. The Browser Company’s innovative approach to integrating AI into its Arc Browser offers a unique solution to differentiate itself from Safari.

The hiring of Apple’s Safari lead designer, Charlie Deets, by The Browser Company is a strategic move to enhance their browser experience with a focus on AI integration.

With the tagline “the browser that browses for you,” the company aims to redefine the way users interact with the internet. This shift in thinking about the browsing experience involves a deep consideration of interface design, which Deets will play a crucial role in developing. The use of AI in the browser will go beyond a simple reskinning of the WebKit engine and offer users a personalized and efficient browsing experience.

As The Browser Company prepares to launch its AI-powered Arc Browser, the industry is watching closely to see how much of an impact AI can have on the browsing experience. With Apple expected to showcase their own AI developments at the upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference, the competition in the browser market is heating up. The adoption of AI by Safari and other browsers will be a key factor in determining the success of AI integration in the browsing industry. The Browser Company is poised to lead the way with its innovative approach to AI in browsers.

In a landscape where the web browser is a critical part of any operating system, changes in how browsers function have the potential to impact millions of users worldwide. The hiring announcement by The Browser Company signals a shift towards a more AI-driven browsing experience, setting the stage for a new era in internet browsing. By bringing in top talent like Charlie Deets, the company is making a clear statement about its commitment to innovation and user-centric design.

Apple Inc. AAPL is alleged to have prevented Jon Stewart, former “Daily Show” host, from hosting a podcast episode with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairwoman Lina Khan. This comes amid ongoing antitrust investigations into Apple’s business practices and market monopoly.

What Happened: Stewart revealed that Apple had blocked him from interviewing FTC Chair Khan on his podcast, “The Problem With Jon Stewart”. The podcast is an offshoot of his AppleTV show that shares the same name.

During a segment on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show, ” Stewart said to Khan, “Apple asked us not to do it. They literally said, ‘please don't talk to her.'”

This development reportedly follows a recent lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against Apple. The lawsuit accuses the tech giant of monopolizing the smartphone market in violation of antitrust laws. The lawsuit also highlights Apple’s growing influence in the TV and movie production industry, which allows it to control content.

Reacting to these allegations, Apple defended its business strategies, expressing that the lawsuit “threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.” Apple insists that a successful lawsuit would impede its ability to deliver the technology customers anticipate.

Why It Matters: The alleged incident indicates the growing tension between tech giants and regulatory bodies. Notably, Stewart has been vocal in criticizing prominent figures in the tech industry. Khan, the FTC Chairwoman, is renowned for her stringent views on antitrust matters. Under her leadership, the FTC has initiated scrutiny of several tech giants, including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia.

In a previous episode of ""The Daily Show,"" he satirically called out individuals such as Mark Zuckerberg, Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, and Satya Nadella for their lofty promises regarding AI potential. The recent incident adds another chapter to the ongoing narrative of big tech’s struggle with antitrust issues.

4/3/2024 13:20,AAPL,Seeking Alpha,Apple's latest research suggests tech giant will be an 'AI winner' (AAPL),"Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest research paper suggests the tech giant will be an ""AI winner"" when it solves the issue of having on-device inference that can enable an iPhone ""supercycle,"" Evercore ISI analysts said.

The research, which was published on Monday, describes Apple's newest language model, known as Reference Resolution As Language Modeling, or ReALM. The researchers indicated the smaller ReALM models were similar in performance to OpenAI's GPT-4, albeit with fewer parameters. This could allow the new model to deliver AI to the edge, or devices such as smartphones and PCs and provide the same function as AI in data centers.

""The key innovation here appears to be around reference resolution, which refers to how AI can understand references to on-screen data as well as more conversational context,"" Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani posited. ""Apple simplifies the normally complex task of reference resolution by converting all on screen data to text, which is far easier for an [large language model] to parse relative to images. This is the key feature that enables Apple to deliver high performance with a more limited number of parameters.""

Daryanani maintained his Outperform rating and $220 price target on Apple.

By offering AI tools on consumer devices (and perhaps increasing the usefulness of Siri), Apple could offer developers lower latency, better security and make it easier and cheaper to do AI-related work, Daryanani said.

""We think AAPL’s AI strategy will focus on incorporating on-device inference for [large language models] that will substantially uplift the user experience for not only the iPhone but also Mac/iPad,"" Daryanani explained. ""Given their vertical integration and especially their control over their own silicon, AAPL is best positioned to not only expand the moat surrounding the iOS ecosystem but also potentially drive an accelerated refresh cycle should the final implementation be deemed a big enough change.""

He continued: ""The refresh cycle will likely be driven by significant updates to the hardware including a potentially improved neural engine or GPU. Additionally, a significant enough upgrade in capabilities could potentially drive an uplift in [average selling prices].""

The rival comes after the EU brought in the Digital Markets Act this year, which aims to promote fair competition in the digital marketplace — and which forced Apple to crack open its App Store in January and to allow iPhone owners in the region to use alternative stores.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Users who want to use the AltStore shouldn't expect a massive change, though.

""It all works virtually the same as the App Store now,"" Riley Testut, the developer of AltStore, told TechCrunch regarding his product.

One difference, however, is that AltStore is designed with the goal of creating a marketplace that gives developers control over their apps' deployment. While Apple must approve apps before putting them in its own store, AltStore allows developers to upload their mobile software without review for immediate distribution, according to the company.

Additionally, it appears to cost developers less money. Apple's in-app subscriptions typically come with a 15% to 30% commission fee on sales that goes to the tech giant. AltStore, however, says it doesn't take a cut. Instead, developers can include a custom Patreon integration to market their apps directly to iPhone users. That way, developers can monetize their offerings without ads, paid downloads, and in-app purchases. They'll also be able to use the same Patreon integration to distribute 'paid' apps, Testut told TechCrunch.

Apple still needs to approve the AltStore before it becomes widely available in the EU, Testut told TechCrunch. And once it does, iPhone users in the region will be able to download apps like Delta, a Nintendo game emulator, and Dolphin, a GameCube and Wii emulator, among others, according to the AltStore website.

Delta, a Nintendo emulator, will be available on AltStore once launched. Riley Testut/AltStore

The emergence of the AltStore after the launch of the DMA also hints at what potential US iPhone changes could look like if Apple loses its battle with the DOJ. US regulators are suing the tech giant, accusing it of using anti-competitive practices to dominate the smartphone market.

""I believe there's a strong possibility we'd see entirely new iOS apps appear that can't exist today due to Apple's rules, especially from independent developers,"" Testut, the developer behind AltStore, previously told Business Insider regarding the lawsuit. The DOJ has accused Apple of not permitting cross-platform apps, locking users into the company's ecosystem.

Industry leaders say if Apple lost to the DOJ, it could result in lower prices, cheaper streaming subscription services, more tap-to-pay options, smartwatch options, and an improved Android-iPhone texting experience.

Not everyone believes these iPhone changes would be good for consumers. Apple, which denies the allegations made in the lawsuit, says it would create a less secure user experience.

""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,"" Apple told BI in March. ""If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect.""

Apple's new development in AI aims to take on OpenAI's GPT products and may make your interactions with virtual assistants like Siri more intuitive.

The ReaLM system, which stands for ""Reference Resolution As Language Modeling,"" understands ambiguous on-screen images and content and conversational context to enable more natural interactions with AI.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The new Apple system outperforms other large language models like GPT-4 when determining context and what linguistic expressions refer to, according to the researchers who created it. And, as a less complex system than other Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT series, researchers called ReaLM ""an ideal choice"" for a context-deciphering system ""that can exist on-device without compromising on performance.""

Related stories

For example, let's say you ask Siri to show you a list of local pharmacies. Upon being presented with the list, you might ask it to ""Call the one on Rainbow Road"" or ""Call the bottom one."" With ReaLM, instead of getting an error message asking for more information, Siri could decipher the context needed to follow through with such a task better than GPT-4 can, according to the Apple researchers who created the system.

""Human speech typically contains ambiguous references such as 'they' or 'that,' whose meaning is obvious (to other humans) given the context,"" the researchers wrote about ReaLM's abilities. ""Being able to understand context, including references like these, is essential for a conversational assistant that aims to allow a user to naturally communicate their requirements to an agent, or to have a conversation with it.""

The ReaLM system can interpret images embedded in text, which the researchers say can be used to extract information like phone numbers or recipes from on-page images.

OpenAI's GPT-3.5 accepts only text input, and GPT-4, which can also contextualize images, is a large system trained mostly on natural, real-world images, not screenshots — which the Apple researchers say hinders its practical performance and makes ReaLM the better option for understanding on-screen information.

""Apple has long been seen as a laggard to Microsoft, Google, and Amazon in developing conversational AI,"" The Information reported. ""The iPhone maker has a reputation for being a careful, deliberate developer of new products — a tactic that's worked well to gain the trust of consumers but may come to hurt it in the fast-paced AI race.""

But with the teasing of ReaLM's capabilities, it appears Apple may be getting ready to enter the race in earnest.

The researchers behind ReaLM and representatives for OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

It remains unclear when or whether ReaLM will be implemented into Siri or other Apple products, but CEO Tim Cook said during a recent earnings call that the company is ""excited to share details of our ongoing work in AI later this year.""","Read previewApple's new development in AI aims to take on OpenAI's GPT products and may make your interactions with virtual assistants like Siri more intuitive.

4/3/2024 11:20,AAPL,Globe Echo,Key Developer Leaves Apple for Rival Browser Company,"In addition to the push for AI integration in browsers, Apple is also facing challenges in the European Union due to its restriction on developers using Apple’s Webkit rendering engine on iPhones and iPads. The European Union’s Digital Markets Act has called out this practice, raising concerns about competition and user choice. This means that any significant changes to the iPhone browser experience will have to focus on the interface rather than the rendering engine. The Browser Company’s innovative approach to integrating AI into its Arc Browser offers a unique solution to differentiate itself from Safari.

The hiring of Apple’s Safari lead designer, Charlie Deets, by The Browser Company is a strategic move to enhance their browser experience with a focus on AI integration. CEO Josh Miller emphasizes the importance of this hiring announcement, highlighting the company’s larger strategic bet in 2024. By bringing in experienced designers like Deets, The Browser Company is positioning itself to revolutionize the browsing experience for users by leveraging AI to proactively support them in their online activities.

The announcement of integrating AI into the Arc Browser is a key part of The Browser Company’s vision for the future of web browsing. With the tagline “the browser that browses for you,” the company aims to redefine the way users interact with the internet. This shift in thinking about the browsing experience involves a deep consideration of interface design, which Deets will play a crucial role in developing. The use of AI in the browser will go beyond a simple reskinning of the WebKit engine and offer users a personalized and efficient browsing experience.

As The Browser Company prepares to launch its AI-powered Arc Browser, the industry is watching closely to see how much of an impact AI can have on the browsing experience. With Apple expected to showcase their own AI developments at the upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference, the competition in the browser market is heating up. The adoption of AI by Safari and other browsers will be a key factor in determining the success of AI integration in the browsing industry. The Browser Company is poised to lead the way with its innovative approach to AI in browsers.

In a landscape where the web browser is a critical part of any operating system, changes in how browsers function have the potential to impact millions of users worldwide. The hiring announcement by The Browser Company signals a shift towards a more AI-driven browsing experience, setting the stage for a new era in internet browsing. By bringing in top talent like Charlie Deets, the company is making a clear statement about its commitment to innovation and user-centric design. With the launch of the Arc Browser on the horizon, The Browser Company is poised to disrupt the browser market and offer users a unique and personalized browsing experience.","This means that any significant changes to the iPhone browser experience will have to focus on the interface rather than the rendering engine.

4/3/2024 11:20,AAPL,Benzinga,'Please Don't Talk To Her' — Apple Called Out By Jon Stewart For Blocking FTC Chair Lina Khan's Interview - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),"Loading... Loading...

Apple Inc. AAPL is alleged to have prevented Jon Stewart, former “Daily Show” host, from hosting a podcast episode with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairwoman Lina Khan. This comes amid ongoing antitrust investigations into Apple’s business practices and market monopoly.

What Happened: Stewart revealed that Apple had blocked him from interviewing FTC Chair Khan on his podcast, “The Problem With Jon Stewart”. The podcast is an offshoot of his AppleTV show that shares the same name.

During a segment on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show, ” Stewart said to Khan, “Apple asked us not to do it. They literally said, ‘please don't talk to her.'”

This development reportedly follows a recent lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against Apple. The lawsuit accuses the tech giant of monopolizing the smartphone market in violation of antitrust laws. The lawsuit also highlights Apple’s growing influence in the TV and movie production industry, which allows it to control content.

Reacting to these allegations, Apple defended its business strategies, expressing that the lawsuit “threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.” Apple insists that a successful lawsuit would impede its ability to deliver the technology customers anticipate.

Why It Matters: The alleged incident indicates the growing tension between tech giants and regulatory bodies. Notably, Stewart has been vocal in criticizing prominent figures in the tech industry. Khan, the FTC Chairwoman, is renowned for her stringent views on antitrust matters. Under her leadership, the FTC has initiated scrutiny of several tech giants, including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia.

In a previous episode of ""The Daily Show,"" he satirically called out individuals such as Mark Zuckerberg, Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, and Satya Nadella for their lofty promises regarding AI potential. The recent incident adds another chapter to the ongoing narrative of big tech’s struggle with antitrust issues.

""Human speech typically contains ambiguous references such as 'they' or 'that,' whose meaning is obvious (to other humans) given the context,"" the researchers wrote about ReaLM's abilities. ""Being able to understand context, including references like these, is essential for a conversational assistant that aims to allow a user to naturally communicate their requirements to an agent, or to have a conversation with it.""

The ReaLM system can interpret images embedded in text, which the researchers say can be used to extract information like phone numbers or recipes from on-page images.

OpenAI's GPT-3.5 accepts only text input, and GPT-4, which can also contextualize images, is a large system trained mostly on natural, real-world images, not screenshots — which the Apple researchers say hinders its practical performance and makes ReaLM the better option for understanding on-screen information.

""Apple has long been seen as a laggard to Microsoft, Google, and Amazon in developing conversational AI,"" The Information reported. ""The iPhone maker has a reputation for being a careful, deliberate developer of new products — a tactic that's worked well to gain the trust of consumers but may come to hurt it in the fast-paced AI race.""

But with the teasing of ReaLM's capabilities, it appears Apple may be getting ready to enter the race in earnest.

The researchers behind ReaLM and representatives for OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

It remains unclear when or whether ReaLM will be implemented into Siri or other Apple products, but CEO Tim Cook said during a recent earnings call that the company is ""excited to share details of our ongoing work in AI later this year.""","Read previewApple's new development in AI aims to take on OpenAI's GPT products and may make your interactions with virtual assistants like Siri more intuitive.

The European Union’s Digital Markets Act has called out this practice, raising concerns about competition and user choice. This means that any significant changes to the iPhone browser experience will have to focus on the interface rather than the rendering engine. The Browser Company’s innovative approach to integrating AI into its Arc Browser offers a unique solution to differentiate itself from Safari.

The hiring of Apple’s Safari lead designer, Charlie Deets, by The Browser Company is a strategic move to enhance their browser experience with a focus on AI integration.

With the tagline “the browser that browses for you,” the company aims to redefine the way users interact with the internet. This shift in thinking about the browsing experience involves a deep consideration of interface design, which Deets will play a crucial role in developing. The use of AI in the browser will go beyond a simple reskinning of the WebKit engine and offer users a personalized and efficient browsing experience.

As The Browser Company prepares to launch its AI-powered Arc Browser, the industry is watching closely to see how much of an impact AI can have on the browsing experience. With Apple expected to showcase their own AI developments at the upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference, the competition in the browser market is heating up. The adoption of AI by Safari and other browsers will be a key factor in determining the success of AI integration in the browsing industry. The Browser Company is poised to lead the way with its innovative approach to AI in browsers.

In a landscape where the web browser is a critical part of any operating system, changes in how browsers function have the potential to impact millions of users worldwide.

Apple Inc. AAPL is alleged to have prevented Jon Stewart, former “Daily Show” host, from hosting a podcast episode with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairwoman Lina Khan. This comes amid ongoing antitrust investigations into Apple’s business practices and market monopoly.

What Happened: Stewart revealed that Apple had blocked him from interviewing FTC Chair Khan on his podcast, “The Problem With Jon Stewart”. The podcast is an offshoot of his AppleTV show that shares the same name.

During a segment on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show, ” Stewart said to Khan, “Apple asked us not to do it. They literally said, ‘please don't talk to her.'”

This development reportedly follows a recent lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against Apple. The lawsuit accuses the tech giant of monopolizing the smartphone market in violation of antitrust laws. The lawsuit also highlights Apple’s growing influence in the TV and movie production industry, which allows it to control content.

Reacting to these allegations, Apple defended its business strategies, expressing that the lawsuit “threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.” Apple insists that a successful lawsuit would impede its ability to deliver the technology customers anticipate.

Why It Matters: The alleged incident indicates the growing tension between tech giants and regulatory bodies. Notably, Stewart has been vocal in criticizing prominent figures in the tech industry. Khan, the FTC Chairwoman, is renowned for her stringent views on antitrust matters. Under her leadership, the FTC has initiated scrutiny of several tech giants, including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia.

In a previous episode of ""The Daily Show,"" he satirically called out individuals such as Mark Zuckerberg, Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, and Satya Nadella for their lofty promises regarding AI potential. The recent incident adds another chapter to the ongoing narrative of big tech’s struggle with antitrust issues.

The research, which was published on Monday, describes Apple's newest language model, known as Reference Resolution As Language Modeling, or ReALM. The researchers indicated the smaller ReALM models were similar in performance to OpenAI's GPT-4, albeit with fewer parameters. This could allow the new model to deliver AI to the edge, or devices such as smartphones and PCs and provide the same function as AI in data centers.

""The key innovation here appears to be around reference resolution, which refers to how AI can understand references to on-screen data as well as more conversational context,"" Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani posited. ""Apple simplifies the normally complex task of reference resolution by converting all on screen data to text, which is far easier for an [large language model] to parse relative to images. This is the key feature that enables Apple to deliver high performance with a more limited number of parameters.""

Daryanani maintained his Outperform rating and $220 price target on Apple.

By offering AI tools on consumer devices (and perhaps increasing the usefulness of Siri), Apple could offer developers lower latency, better security and make it easier and cheaper to do AI-related work, Daryanani said.

""We think AAPL’s AI strategy will focus on incorporating on-device inference for [large language models] that will substantially uplift the user experience for not only the iPhone but also Mac/iPad,"" Daryanani explained. ""Given their vertical integration and especially their control over their own silicon, AAPL is best positioned to not only expand the moat surrounding the iOS ecosystem but also potentially drive an accelerated refresh cycle should the final implementation be deemed a big enough change.""

A new app store coming to iPhones in the EU provides a glimpse into what changes iPhone users in the US can expect if the Department of Justice wins its antitrust lawsuit against Apple.

AltStore is a third-party app store that seeks to be an alternative to Apple's default. The rival comes after the EU brought in the Digital Markets Act this year, which aims to promote fair competition in the digital marketplace — and which forced Apple to crack open its App Store in January and to allow iPhone owners in the region to use alternative stores.

Users who want to use the AltStore shouldn't expect a massive change, though.

""It all works virtually the same as the App Store now,"" Riley Testut, the developer of AltStore, told TechCrunch regarding his product.

One difference, however, is that AltStore is designed with the goal of creating a marketplace that gives developers control over their apps' deployment. While Apple must approve apps before putting them in its own store, AltStore allows developers to upload their mobile software without review for immediate distribution, according to the company.

Related stories

Additionally, it appears to cost developers less money. Apple's in-app subscriptions typically come with a 15% to 30% commission fee on sales that goes to the tech giant. AltStore, however, says it doesn't take a cut. Instead, developers can include a custom Patreon integration to market their apps directly to iPhone users. That way, developers can monetize their offerings without ads, paid downloads, and in-app purchases. They'll also be able to use the same Patreon integration to distribute 'paid' apps, Testut told TechCrunch.

Apple still needs to approve the AltStore before it becomes widely available in the EU, Testut told TechCrunch. And once it does, iPhone users in the region will be able to download apps like Delta, a Nintendo game emulator, and Dolphin, a GameCube and Wii emulator, among others, according to the AltStore website.

Delta, a Nintendo emulator, will be available on AltStore once launched. Riley Testut/AltStore

The emergence of the AltStore after the launch of the DMA also hints at what potential US iPhone changes could look like if Apple loses its battle with the DOJ. US regulators are suing the tech giant, accusing it of using anti-competitive practices to dominate the smartphone market.

""I believe there's a strong possibility we'd see entirely new iOS apps appear that can't exist today due to Apple's rules, especially from independent developers,"" Testut, the developer behind AltStore, previously told Business Insider regarding the lawsuit. The DOJ has accused Apple of not permitting cross-platform apps, locking users into the company's ecosystem.

Industry leaders say if Apple lost to the DOJ, it could result in lower prices, cheaper streaming subscription services, more tap-to-pay options, smartwatch options, and an improved Android-iPhone texting experience.

Not everyone believes these iPhone changes would be good for consumers. Apple, which denies the allegations made in the lawsuit, says it would create a less secure user experience.

""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,"" Apple told BI in March. ""If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect.""

4/3/2024 12:21,AAPL,Yahoo Lifestyle Canada,Apple Vision Pro’s Persona feature gets collaborative,"Much like the headset for which they were designed, Apple’s Personas are very much a work in progress. The original version of the beta avatars were — is “nightmarish” too strong a word? A subsequent update has made them more palatable and truer to life, and Apple says it's continuing to work on the 3D captures.

The company on Tuesday debuted “spatial” Personas for Vision Pro headsets running visionOS 1.1 or later. Whereas the feature was previously limited to chat platforms like FaceTime and Zoom, the new version is designed to bring an added sense of collaboration to the headset.

The spatial aspect still starts with FaceTime, but Apple’s proprietary videoconferencing platform now serves as a gateway to other apps when combined with SharePlay. From there, users can select the spatial persona option, which utilizes the Vision Pro’s on-board sensors to place the Persona in the room with them.

Spatial audio, meanwhile, further places them at a specific point in space relative to the Vision Pro user.

In the video example shared by Apple, two Personas flank a window showcasing Freeform. Taken together, this approximates the sense of people collaborating on a project across an office conference table. In this case, however, that conference table is the user’s desk at home.

Is the effect neat? Yes. Is it creepy? Also, yes. Vision Pro users will continue doing business in the uncanny valley for the foreseeable future. That just comes with the territory of being an early adopter.

In addition to work collaborations, the feature can be used to watch movies and play games together. It supports up to five users at once.","A subsequent update has made them more palatable and truer to life, and Apple says it's continuing to work on the 3D captures.

The podcast that Stewart wanted to have the FTC chair join as a guest was attached to the Apple TV+ show ""The Problem With Jon Stewart"" that he hosted for about two years.

But, according to Stewart, the tech company ""literally said, ‘Please don’t talk to her,’ having nothing to do with what you do for a living."" FOX Business reached out to Apple for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

While hosting the show’s two seasons, he interviewed guests such as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Disney's Bob Iger, among others.

4/3/2024 10:21,AAPL,Irish Examiner,Apple stock market investors look for signs worst is over after $300bn slump,"With Apple's shares coming off their poorest quarterly performance relative to the main US stock market index — the S&P 500 Index — in over a decade, traders are looking for signs that the worst may be over.

The 12% drop since the start of the year paid off for short sellers, giving them an incentive to unwind their bets. Technical analysts say the stock is flirting with levels where dip-buyers are likely to swoop in. And the lagging run may make Apple look cheap compared with the other big tech companies.

“Nobody wants to sell anymore of their Apple positions because there’s a dividend, big share buybacks and no one wants to pay capital-gains taxes on it,” said Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler.

“I don’t see the stock falling much further from here. The bigger risk is that Apple’s stock may be stuck in a range between $165 to $200 until it can decisively break above its longer-term moving averages,” Mr Johnson said. Apple shares fell about 1% at one stage in the latest trading session.

The slide has erased more than $300bn (€279bn) in stock market value this year, ceding Apple’s status as the most valuable US company to Microsoft. The drop was spurred by declining sales in China, regulatory scrutiny of its App store, and mounting concern among investors about its growth outlook.

As the S&P 500 gained, Apple’s return lagged it by 21 percentage points in the first quarter, the worst showing by that measure since 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

But the loss has been steep enough that it’s nearing a key support level at $165, the low it hit in October, when the broader market also bottomed out.

Short sellers pounced on Apple as peers like Nvidia, Meta, and Amazon, kept rallying. Apple is the second-most profitable short position this year at $2.4bn in paper profits, according to data-analytics firm S3 Partners.

That may give them some incentive to unwind the positions, and while the size of open short positions hasn’t changed much, they’re down from levels seen last year.

With Apple faltering, traders are growing concerned that tech shares may face pressure in the coming months — even with Nvidia’s dominance. That suggests a momentum divergence has formed in the tech sector versus the broader market.

That said, Apple traditionally serves as a flight-to-safety trade due to its strong business model and cash generation.

Founders Jobs and Wozniak, both college dropouts, founded the company with the idea of changing the way people looked at computers. Their vision coincided with a revolution within the PC industry and helped to create personal computing as we know it today. The company’s first product was a personal computer known as the Apple 1 but the product line has since evolved to include a wide range of desirable personal computing devices.

Apple is headquartered in Apple Park, an ultra-modern campus built in Cupertino, California. The campus features a massive circular building nicknamed The Spaceship and provides working space for over 12,000 employees. The circular shape houses a park and a pond and there are many amenities within the facility including cafes, a wellness center, care clinics, and terminals for the shuttle system.

The company’s core product line has shifted away from computers over the years and towards iPhones and devices but computing is still fundamental to the business. In regard to iPhones, Apple’s products are routinely ranked as the top-selling in all comparisons. Other product lines include Mac (a line of computers), iPad (a line of tablets), AirPods (wifi-enabled earbuds), wearables like the Watch, home accessories such as Apple TV, and smart-home devices like the HomePod.

Apple's new development in AI aims to take on OpenAI's GPT products and may make your interactions with virtual assistants like Siri more intuitive.

The ReaLM system, which stands for ""Reference Resolution As Language Modeling,"" understands ambiguous on-screen images and content and conversational context to enable more natural interactions with AI.

The new Apple system outperforms other large language models like GPT-4 when determining context and what linguistic expressions refer to, according to the researchers who created it. And, as a less complex system than other Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT series, researchers called ReaLM ""an ideal choice"" for a context-deciphering system ""that can exist on-device without compromising on performance.""

Related stories

For example, let's say you ask Siri to show you a list of local pharmacies. Upon being presented with the list, you might ask it to ""Call the one on Rainbow Road"" or ""Call the bottom one."" With ReaLM, instead of getting an error message asking for more information, Siri could decipher the context needed to follow through with such a task better than GPT-4 can, according to the Apple researchers who created the system.

""Human speech typically contains ambiguous references such as 'they' or 'that,' whose meaning is obvious (to other humans) given the context,"" the researchers wrote about ReaLM's abilities. ""Being able to understand context, including references like these, is essential for a conversational assistant that aims to allow a user to naturally communicate their requirements to an agent, or to have a conversation with it.""

The ReaLM system can interpret images embedded in text, which the researchers say can be used to extract information like phone numbers or recipes from on-page images.

OpenAI's GPT-3.5 accepts only text input, and GPT-4, which can also contextualize images, is a large system trained mostly on natural, real-world images, not screenshots — which the Apple researchers say hinders its practical performance and makes ReaLM the better option for understanding on-screen information.

""Apple has long been seen as a laggard to Microsoft, Google, and Amazon in developing conversational AI,"" The Information reported. ""The iPhone maker has a reputation for being a careful, deliberate developer of new products — a tactic that's worked well to gain the trust of consumers but may come to hurt it in the fast-paced AI race.""

But with the teasing of ReaLM's capabilities, it appears Apple may be getting ready to enter the race in earnest.

The researchers behind ReaLM and representatives for OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

It remains unclear when or whether ReaLM will be implemented into Siri or other Apple products, but CEO Tim Cook said during a recent earnings call that the company is ""excited to share details of our ongoing work in AI later this year.""","Apple researchers developed a new AI system to ""see"" and interpret context from on-screen content.

4/3/2024 11:20,AAPL,Globe Echo,Key Developer Leaves Apple for Rival Browser Company,"In addition to the push for AI integration in browsers, Apple is also facing challenges in the European Union due to its restriction on developers using Apple’s Webkit rendering engine on iPhones and iPads. The European Union’s Digital Markets Act has called out this practice, raising concerns about competition and user choice. This means that any significant changes to the iPhone browser experience will have to focus on the interface rather than the rendering engine. The Browser Company’s innovative approach to integrating AI into its Arc Browser offers a unique solution to differentiate itself from Safari.

The hiring of Apple’s Safari lead designer, Charlie Deets, by The Browser Company is a strategic move to enhance their browser experience with a focus on AI integration.

The announcement of integrating AI into the Arc Browser is a key part of The Browser Company’s vision for the future of web browsing. With the tagline “the browser that browses for you,” the company aims to redefine the way users interact with the internet. This shift in thinking about the browsing experience involves a deep consideration of interface design, which Deets will play a crucial role in developing. The use of AI in the browser will go beyond a simple reskinning of the WebKit engine and offer users a personalized and efficient browsing experience.

As The Browser Company prepares to launch its AI-powered Arc Browser, the industry is watching closely to see how much of an impact AI can have on the browsing experience. With Apple expected to showcase their own AI developments at the upcoming Worldwide Developer Conference, the competition in the browser market is heating up. The adoption of AI by Safari and other browsers will be a key factor in determining the success of AI integration in the browsing industry. The Browser Company is poised to lead the way with its innovative approach to AI in browsers.

In a landscape where the web browser is a critical part of any operating system, changes in how browsers function have the potential to impact millions of users worldwide. The hiring announcement by The Browser Company signals a shift towards a more AI-driven browsing experience, setting the stage for a new era in internet browsing. By bringing in top talent like Charlie Deets, the company is making a clear statement about its commitment to innovation and user-centric design.

Apple Inc. AAPL is alleged to have prevented Jon Stewart, former “Daily Show” host, from hosting a podcast episode with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chairwoman Lina Khan. This comes amid ongoing antitrust investigations into Apple’s business practices and market monopoly.

What Happened: Stewart revealed that Apple had blocked him from interviewing FTC Chair Khan on his podcast, “The Problem With Jon Stewart”. The podcast is an offshoot of his AppleTV show that shares the same name.

During a segment on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show, ” Stewart said to Khan, “Apple asked us not to do it. They literally said, ‘please don't talk to her.'”

This development reportedly follows a recent lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against Apple. The lawsuit accuses the tech giant of monopolizing the smartphone market in violation of antitrust laws. The lawsuit also highlights Apple’s growing influence in the TV and movie production industry, which allows it to control content.

Reacting to these allegations, Apple defended its business strategies, expressing that the lawsuit “threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets.” Apple insists that a successful lawsuit would impede its ability to deliver the technology customers anticipate.

Why It Matters: The alleged incident indicates the growing tension between tech giants and regulatory bodies. Notably, Stewart has been vocal in criticizing prominent figures in the tech industry. Khan, the FTC Chairwoman, is renowned for her stringent views on antitrust matters. Under her leadership, the FTC has initiated scrutiny of several tech giants, including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia.

In a previous episode of ""The Daily Show,"" he satirically called out individuals such as Mark Zuckerberg, Sam Altman, Sundar Pichai, and Satya Nadella for their lofty promises regarding AI potential. The recent incident adds another chapter to the ongoing narrative of big tech’s struggle with antitrust issues.

The company’s first product was a personal computer known as the Apple 1 but the product line has since evolved to include a wide range of desirable personal computing devices.

Tim Cook took over the role of CEO in 2011 shortly before the death of Steve Jobs. Cook joined the company in 1988 as Senior VP of Global Sales and went on to become Executive VP of Global Operations before taking on the chief executive role. In his tenure, Mr. Cook has more than doubled Apple’s revenue and earnings while growing the company’s value by more than 450%.

The company designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories worldwide. Apple also provides and sells related platforms and services to power them and is the host of a widely-used digital ecosystem. The digital ecosystem revolves around the Apple App Store which lists thousands of games and applications for iOS users. The App Store also features digital content like music, TV, and movies as well as books, podcasts, and other forms of digital content.

Apple is headquartered in Apple Park, an ultra-modern campus built in Cupertino, California. The campus features a massive circular building nicknamed The Spaceship and provides working space for over 12,000 employees. The circular shape houses a park and a pond and there are many amenities within the facility including cafes, a wellness center, care clinics, and terminals for the shuttle system.

The company’s core product line has shifted away from computers over the years and towards iPhones and devices but computing is still fundamental to the business. In regard to iPhones, Apple’s products are routinely ranked as the top-selling in all comparisons. Other product lines include Mac (a line of computers), iPad (a line of tablets), AirPods (wifi-enabled earbuds), wearables like the Watch, home accessories such as Apple TV, and smart-home devices like the HomePod.

Finally, Apple provides AppleCare support services, cloud store services, and a host of other service offerings intended to simplify life. Among them are Apple News (subscription news), Apple TV+ (subscription TV with original content), Apple Card (consumer credit card), and Apple Pay (mobile cashless pay feature).

Apple computers and wifi-enabled smart devices are in demand by consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, the education sector, enterprises, and governments worldwide because they are high-quality, long-lasting, powerful devices. The company sells its products through an omnichannel network of DTC, wholesales, and eCommerce channels including mobile carriers, retailers, and resellers.","The company’s first product was a personal computer known as the Apple 1 but the product line has since evolved to include a wide range of desirable personal computing devices.

The ""Reference Resolution As Language Modeling"" system allows for more natural interactions with AI.

The researchers behind ReaLM say it outperforms OpenAI's GPT-4 in understanding context.

Apple's new development in AI aims to take on OpenAI's GPT products and may make your interactions with virtual assistants like Siri more intuitive.

The ReaLM system, which stands for ""Reference Resolution As Language Modeling,"" understands ambiguous on-screen images and content and conversational context to enable more natural interactions with AI.

The new Apple system outperforms other large language models like GPT-4 when determining context and what linguistic expressions refer to, according to the researchers who created it. And, as a less complex system than other Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT series, researchers called ReaLM ""an ideal choice"" for a context-deciphering system ""that can exist on-device without compromising on performance.""

For example, let's say you ask Siri to show you a list of local pharmacies. Upon being presented with the list, you might ask it to ""Call the one on Rainbow Road"" or ""Call the bottom one."" With ReaLM, instead of getting an error message asking for more information, Siri could decipher the context needed to follow through with such a task better than GPT-4 can, according to the Apple researchers who created the system.

""Human speech typically contains ambiguous references such as 'they' or 'that,' whose meaning is obvious (to other humans) given the context,"" the researchers wrote about ReaLM's abilities. ""Being able to understand context, including references like these, is essential for a conversational assistant that aims to allow a user to naturally communicate their requirements to an agent, or to have a conversation with it.""

The ReaLM system can interpret images embedded in text, which the researchers say can be used to extract information like phone numbers or recipes from on-page images.

OpenAI's GPT-3.5 accepts only text input, and GPT-4, which can also contextualize images, is a large system trained mostly on natural, real-world images, not screenshots — which the Apple researchers say hinders its practical performance and makes ReaLM the better option for understanding on-screen information.

""Apple has long been seen as a laggard to Microsoft, Google, and Amazon in developing conversational AI,"" The Information reported. ""The iPhone maker has a reputation for being a careful, deliberate developer of new products — a tactic that's worked well to gain the trust of consumers but may come to hurt it in the fast-paced AI race.""

But with the teasing of ReaLM's capabilities, it appears Apple may be getting ready to enter the race in earnest.

The researchers behind ReaLM and representatives for OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

It remains unclear when or whether ReaLM will be implemented into Siri or other Apple products, but CEO Tim Cook said during a recent earnings call that the company is ""excited to share details of our ongoing work in AI later this year.""","Apple researchers developed a new AI system to ""see"" and interpret context from on-screen content.

4/3/2024 15:13,META,Mashable India,Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Gave Netflix Access To Read DMs Of Users; Elon Musk Reacts To The Expose,"> Tech

Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta is embroiled in yet another controversy surrounding user data privacy. In the unsealed court documents from an ongoing lawsuit against Meta, made public last week, Facebook allegedly allowed Netflix a sneak peek of private DMs (direct messages) of FB users. The lawsuit filed in 2023 alleges that the social media behemoth earned millions in ad revenues with its ties with the streaming giant, which reportedly had access to user data for about a decade. The lawsuit states that “Netflix and Facebook enjoyed a special relationship” for nearly a decade. It states that the OTT giant bought “hundreds of millions of dollars in Facebook ads” and that they entered into a series of agreements allowing sharing data with Facebook. It further alleges that the company gained “bespoke access” to private Facebook APIs. A screenshot of the document went viral on X that casts aspersions on the roles of Netflix CEO Warren Hastings, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and former CEO Sheryl Sandberg. Hastings joined the Facebook board in June 2011 and left in April 2019. The lawsuit’s document further reads, “Netflix programmatic access to Facebook’s private message inboxes.” “In exchange,” it further reads, “ Netflix would provide to Facebook a written report every two weeks. The report reveals “daily counts of recommendation sends and recipient clicks” that are generated by metrics from “interface, initiation surface, and/or implementation variation (e.g., Facebook vs. non-Facebook recommendation receipts).”

Musk reacted to the Meta-Netflix revelations on a couple of viral posts, expressing a cheeky ‘wow.’ The billionaire boss of Tesla, X/Twitter, and SpaceX has previously ridiculed Mark Zuckerberg and his platforms.

Meanwhile, responding to one of the viral posts, Meta’s director of communication, Andy Stone, remarked that the company doesn’t share the private messages of its users with Netflix. He stated that the agreement between the two companies allowed users to share their friends' current watchlists on Facebook directly from the OTT’s app. Andy claimed that “such agreements are commonplace in the industry.”

4/3/2024 15:13,META,Mashable India,Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Gave Netflix Access To Read DMs Of Users; Elon Musk Reacts To The Expose,"> Tech

Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta is embroiled in yet another controversy surrounding user data privacy. In the unsealed court documents from an ongoing lawsuit against Meta, made public last week, Facebook allegedly allowed Netflix a sneak peek of private DMs (direct messages) of FB users. The lawsuit filed in 2023 alleges that the social media behemoth earned millions in ad revenues with its ties with the streaming giant, which reportedly had access to user data for about a decade. The lawsuit states that “Netflix and Facebook enjoyed a special relationship” for nearly a decade. It states that the OTT giant bought “hundreds of millions of dollars in Facebook ads” and that they entered into a series of agreements allowing sharing data with Facebook. It further alleges that the company gained “bespoke access” to private Facebook APIs. A screenshot of the document went viral on X that casts aspersions on the roles of Netflix CEO Warren Hastings, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and former CEO Sheryl Sandberg. Hastings joined the Facebook board in June 2011 and left in April 2019. The lawsuit’s document further reads, “Netflix programmatic access to Facebook’s private message inboxes.” “In exchange,” it further reads, “ Netflix would provide to Facebook a written report every two weeks. The report reveals “daily counts of recommendation sends and recipient clicks” that are generated by metrics from “interface, initiation surface, and/or implementation variation (e.g., Facebook vs. non-Facebook recommendation receipts).”

Musk reacted to the Meta-Netflix revelations on a couple of viral posts, expressing a cheeky ‘wow.’ The billionaire boss of Tesla, X/Twitter, and SpaceX has previously ridiculed Mark Zuckerberg and his platforms.

Meanwhile, responding to one of the viral posts, Meta’s director of communication, Andy Stone, remarked that the company doesn’t share the private messages of its users with Netflix. He stated that the agreement between the two companies allowed users to share their friends' current watchlists on Facebook directly from the OTT’s app. Andy claimed that “such agreements are commonplace in the industry.”

4/3/2024 10:22,META,EIN News,Context Before Code: Meta’s Oversight Board Policy Advisory Opinion on the word “Shaheed” calls for language and cultural nuance in content moderation,"“Shaheed” شهيد is one of the names of Allah in Islam and a term used across languages including Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, Farsi, and Turkish. “Shaheed” carries multiple meanings and has many variations, including “witness” or “martyr.” It also appears in the Quran over thirty times and is used by the news media to refer to victims of political assassinations. According to the long-awaited Policy Advisory Opinion published by the Meta Oversight Board last week, it is also the most moderated word on Meta’s platforms.

The Board’s opinion tackles Meta’s moderation of “shaheed” in reference to Meta’s Dangerous Organization and Individuals (DOI) list, which has been previously criticized for over-representing Arabs and Muslims. Meta removes content praising any of the entities or individuals on the list, and its policies reportedly result in suppressing neutral conversations or informational discussions involving any of those listed. After nearly one year (delayed in part by the October 7 attacks in Israel and the ongoing war in Gaza), the Oversight Board concludes that a poor transliteration of “shaheed” from Arabic to English and a set of opaque internal processes has led to a “blanket ban” of the term across services without disclosure to Arabic speakers who use the platform. That ban has resulted in an overbroad, substantial, and disproportionate restriction of an entire community’s freedom of expression, exacerbating distrust and reinforcing biased perceptions.

The Board makes a number of key recommendations for Meta, articulating the need for more clarity and transparency around the platform’s DOI policy, enforcement of that policy, and the use of automated content moderation tools. The Opinion lays out steps for Meta to reverse the ban on the term “shaheed”, update internal guidance provided to moderation teams to make clear that the use of “shaheed” does not violate the company’s policy unless it is also accompanied by signals of violence and still may be important to keep up due to the use of the term in reporting, and to periodically audit the company’s DOI policies and channels. The Opinion also calls for greater transparency to users, which will enable them to know what is and is not permitted, to make more informed decisions about how to use the platform, and to assert their rights should they want to appeal a decision. The Board’s decision, however, is not binding or immediately enforced. Meta has three months to respond.

This decision is in line with the globally-developed Santa Clara Principles, which have long called on companies to take cultural and linguistic context into consideration when developing and enforcing content moderation policies. Comments submitted by over 100 organizations and individuals, including many Arabic-language experts, as part of the development of this Policy Advisory Opinion make clear that there is no direct correlation between all uses of the term “shaheed” and real-world harm. The findings lay bare the company’s incomplete understanding of the ways in which the Arabic-speaking community uses the term. This Opinion will serve as an important milestone if its effect is used to spur greater engagement with language speakers and experts around the world.

The Opinion lays out steps for the company to explain how classifiers and automated tools generate predictions of policy violations and asks the company to assess its classifiers. Such tools are likely to have more shortcomings in languages other than English, particularly in low-resource languages. Low-resource languages are those languages that have fewer high-quality digitized examples of text to train and evaluate models. While Arabic is a medium-resourced language, some dialects of the polyglossic language such as the Arabic spoken in the Maghreb are considered lower-resourced, a dialect we are studying as part of a CDT research project on content moderation systems in the Global South.

Academics have also argued that the Arabic training data used to train automated systems is not representative of how Arabic speakers use the language. For example, if Arabic language training data is machine translated or only depicts the use of the term “shaheed” in contexts of violence, then the model will develop an incomplete understanding of a word used in expansive and multifaceted ways. That, in turn, will lead to Arabic speakers being routinely and disproportionately subject to inconsistent moderation.

Further, without adequate benchmarks across languages, we will never know whether these automated content moderation tools work equitably. Currently, large tech companies tout the performance of their multilingual tools yet disclose in fine print that they are tested on entirely American English prompts or machine-translated ones. (Meta’s XLM-R, for example, is a model the company claims can moderate content in more than 160 languages, but the model is only tested on English and machine-translated benchmarks in a handful of languages.) Both of these are inadequate proxies for gauging multilingual capability especially in context-specific tasks such as content moderation.

CDT has called on companies to invest in digitizing low resource languages, to create evaluation benchmarks for languages other than English, and to work with NLP communities that are experts in language and cultural contexts to do so. Future research and guidance offered by the Board should look into how and whether Meta is taking these steps, including in Arabic across dialects. The Advisory Opinion should also be a call to others in the ecosystem to promote a virtuous cycle of investment in curating datasets of low resource languages, training language models, and building tools.","According to the long-awaited Policy Advisory Opinion published by the Meta Oversight Board last week, it is also the most moderated word on Meta’s platforms.

4/3/2024 10:22,META,EIN News,Context Before Code: Meta’s Oversight Board Policy Advisory Opinion on the word “Shaheed” calls for language and cultural nuance in content moderation,"“Shaheed” شهيد is one of the names of Allah in Islam and a term used across languages including Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, Farsi, and Turkish. “Shaheed” carries multiple meanings and has many variations, including “witness” or “martyr.” It also appears in the Quran over thirty times and is used by the news media to refer to victims of political assassinations. According to the long-awaited Policy Advisory Opinion published by the Meta Oversight Board last week, it is also the most moderated word on Meta’s platforms.

The Board’s opinion tackles Meta’s moderation of “shaheed” in reference to Meta’s Dangerous Organization and Individuals (DOI) list, which has been previously criticized for over-representing Arabs and Muslims. Meta removes content praising any of the entities or individuals on the list, and its policies reportedly result in suppressing neutral conversations or informational discussions involving any of those listed. After nearly one year (delayed in part by the October 7 attacks in Israel and the ongoing war in Gaza), the Oversight Board concludes that a poor transliteration of “shaheed” from Arabic to English and a set of opaque internal processes has led to a “blanket ban” of the term across services without disclosure to Arabic speakers who use the platform. That ban has resulted in an overbroad, substantial, and disproportionate restriction of an entire community’s freedom of expression, exacerbating distrust and reinforcing biased perceptions.

The Board makes a number of key recommendations for Meta, articulating the need for more clarity and transparency around the platform’s DOI policy, enforcement of that policy, and the use of automated content moderation tools. The Opinion lays out steps for Meta to reverse the ban on the term “shaheed”, update internal guidance provided to moderation teams to make clear that the use of “shaheed” does not violate the company’s policy unless it is also accompanied by signals of violence and still may be important to keep up due to the use of the term in reporting, and to periodically audit the company’s DOI policies and channels. The Opinion also calls for greater transparency to users, which will enable them to know what is and is not permitted, to make more informed decisions about how to use the platform, and to assert their rights should they want to appeal a decision. The Board’s decision, however, is not binding or immediately enforced. Meta has three months to respond.

This decision is in line with the globally-developed Santa Clara Principles, which have long called on companies to take cultural and linguistic context into consideration when developing and enforcing content moderation policies. Comments submitted by over 100 organizations and individuals, including many Arabic-language experts, as part of the development of this Policy Advisory Opinion make clear that there is no direct correlation between all uses of the term “shaheed” and real-world harm. The findings lay bare the company’s incomplete understanding of the ways in which the Arabic-speaking community uses the term. This Opinion will serve as an important milestone if its effect is used to spur greater engagement with language speakers and experts around the world.

The Opinion lays out steps for the company to explain how classifiers and automated tools generate predictions of policy violations and asks the company to assess its classifiers. Such tools are likely to have more shortcomings in languages other than English, particularly in low-resource languages. Low-resource languages are those languages that have fewer high-quality digitized examples of text to train and evaluate models. While Arabic is a medium-resourced language, some dialects of the polyglossic language such as the Arabic spoken in the Maghreb are considered lower-resourced, a dialect we are studying as part of a CDT research project on content moderation systems in the Global South.

Academics have also argued that the Arabic training data used to train automated systems is not representative of how Arabic speakers use the language. For example, if Arabic language training data is machine translated or only depicts the use of the term “shaheed” in contexts of violence, then the model will develop an incomplete understanding of a word used in expansive and multifaceted ways. That, in turn, will lead to Arabic speakers being routinely and disproportionately subject to inconsistent moderation.

Further, without adequate benchmarks across languages, we will never know whether these automated content moderation tools work equitably. Currently, large tech companies tout the performance of their multilingual tools yet disclose in fine print that they are tested on entirely American English prompts or machine-translated ones. (Meta’s XLM-R, for example, is a model the company claims can moderate content in more than 160 languages, but the model is only tested on English and machine-translated benchmarks in a handful of languages.) Both of these are inadequate proxies for gauging multilingual capability especially in context-specific tasks such as content moderation.

CDT has called on companies to invest in digitizing low resource languages, to create evaluation benchmarks for languages other than English, and to work with NLP communities that are experts in language and cultural contexts to do so. Future research and guidance offered by the Board should look into how and whether Meta is taking these steps, including in Arabic across dialects. The Advisory Opinion should also be a call to others in the ecosystem to promote a virtuous cycle of investment in curating datasets of low resource languages, training language models, and building tools.","According to the long-awaited Policy Advisory Opinion published by the Meta Oversight Board last week, it is also the most moderated word on Meta’s platforms.

In a bombshell lawsuit against Facebook's parent company Meta, it has been alleged that Netflix had access to users' private Facebook messages as part of a secretive and longstanding ""special relationship"" between the tech giants.



Meta reports of this data trade being happening “for close to a decade.” And that Netflix is giving back the user data in exchange of private messages.

The lawsuit filed by Maximilian Klein and Sarah Grabert challenges the companies who in an agreement allegedly shared ""client-specific access"" that enable Netflix to tailor the content to users.

Netflix and Meta's mutually successful business ties may have resulted from Reed Hastings good friendships with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, according to the press.

Formally, Hastings, who was a member of the board of Facebook from 2011 to 2019, is reported to have played a key role in their connection during that timeframe.

It was reported in court documents that the two companies made arrangements to tailor corporate collaborations and other integrations in order to help Facebook in its ad-matching and ranking models.

The Facebook board 30 days after Hastings joining it allegedly had an ""Inbox API"" agreement signed, provided to Netflix programatic access to users private messenger interface.

Besides a lawsuit involving Netflix and Facebook connection, it is also argued that Facebook received fortnightly reports from Netflix on user activities, bringing to light a comprehensive data-sharing deal between the two companies.

Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta is embroiled in yet another controversy surrounding user data privacy. In the unsealed court documents from an ongoing lawsuit against Meta, made public last week, Facebook allegedly allowed Netflix a sneak peek of private DMs (direct messages) of FB users. The lawsuit filed in 2023 alleges that the social media behemoth earned millions in ad revenues with its ties with the streaming giant, which reportedly had access to user data for about a decade. The lawsuit states that “Netflix and Facebook enjoyed a special relationship” for nearly a decade. It states that the OTT giant bought “hundreds of millions of dollars in Facebook ads” and that they entered into a series of agreements allowing sharing data with Facebook. It further alleges that the company gained “bespoke access” to private Facebook APIs. A screenshot of the document went viral on X that casts aspersions on the roles of Netflix CEO Warren Hastings, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and former CEO Sheryl Sandberg. Hastings joined the Facebook board in June 2011 and left in April 2019. The lawsuit’s document further reads, “Netflix programmatic access to Facebook’s private message inboxes.” “In exchange,” it further reads, “ Netflix would provide to Facebook a written report every two weeks. The report reveals “daily counts of recommendation sends and recipient clicks” that are generated by metrics from “interface, initiation surface, and/or implementation variation (e.g., Facebook vs. non-Facebook recommendation receipts).”

Musk reacted to the Meta-Netflix revelations on a couple of viral posts, expressing a cheeky ‘wow.’ The billionaire boss of Tesla, X/Twitter, and SpaceX has previously ridiculed Mark Zuckerberg and his platforms.

Meanwhile, responding to one of the viral posts, Meta’s director of communication, Andy Stone, remarked that the company doesn’t share the private messages of its users with Netflix. He stated that the agreement between the two companies allowed users to share their friends' current watchlists on Facebook directly from the OTT’s app. Andy claimed that “such agreements are commonplace in the industry.”

4/3/2024 15:13,META,Mashable India,Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Gave Netflix Access To Read DMs Of Users; Elon Musk Reacts To The Expose,"> Tech

Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta is embroiled in yet another controversy surrounding user data privacy. In the unsealed court documents from an ongoing lawsuit against Meta, made public last week, Facebook allegedly allowed Netflix a sneak peek of private DMs (direct messages) of FB users. The lawsuit filed in 2023 alleges that the social media behemoth earned millions in ad revenues with its ties with the streaming giant, which reportedly had access to user data for about a decade. The lawsuit states that “Netflix and Facebook enjoyed a special relationship” for nearly a decade. It states that the OTT giant bought “hundreds of millions of dollars in Facebook ads” and that they entered into a series of agreements allowing sharing data with Facebook. It further alleges that the company gained “bespoke access” to private Facebook APIs. A screenshot of the document went viral on X that casts aspersions on the roles of Netflix CEO Warren Hastings, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and former CEO Sheryl Sandberg. Hastings joined the Facebook board in June 2011 and left in April 2019. The lawsuit’s document further reads, “Netflix programmatic access to Facebook’s private message inboxes.” “In exchange,” it further reads, “ Netflix would provide to Facebook a written report every two weeks. The report reveals “daily counts of recommendation sends and recipient clicks” that are generated by metrics from “interface, initiation surface, and/or implementation variation (e.g., Facebook vs. non-Facebook recommendation receipts).”

Musk reacted to the Meta-Netflix revelations on a couple of viral posts, expressing a cheeky ‘wow.’ The billionaire boss of Tesla, X/Twitter, and SpaceX has previously ridiculed Mark Zuckerberg and his platforms.

Meanwhile, responding to one of the viral posts, Meta’s director of communication, Andy Stone, remarked that the company doesn’t share the private messages of its users with Netflix. He stated that the agreement between the two companies allowed users to share their friends' current watchlists on Facebook directly from the OTT’s app. Andy claimed that “such agreements are commonplace in the industry.”

NB: This is a developing story. More details will be added later.

4/3/2024 10:22,META,EIN News,Context Before Code: Meta’s Oversight Board Policy Advisory Opinion on the word “Shaheed” calls for language and cultural nuance in content moderation,"“Shaheed” شهيد is one of the names of Allah in Islam and a term used across languages including Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, Farsi, and Turkish. “Shaheed” carries multiple meanings and has many variations, including “witness” or “martyr.” It also appears in the Quran over thirty times and is used by the news media to refer to victims of political assassinations. According to the long-awaited Policy Advisory Opinion published by the Meta Oversight Board last week, it is also the most moderated word on Meta’s platforms.

The Board’s opinion tackles Meta’s moderation of “shaheed” in reference to Meta’s Dangerous Organization and Individuals (DOI) list, which has been previously criticized for over-representing Arabs and Muslims. Meta removes content praising any of the entities or individuals on the list, and its policies reportedly result in suppressing neutral conversations or informational discussions involving any of those listed. After nearly one year (delayed in part by the October 7 attacks in Israel and the ongoing war in Gaza), the Oversight Board concludes that a poor transliteration of “shaheed” from Arabic to English and a set of opaque internal processes has led to a “blanket ban” of the term across services without disclosure to Arabic speakers who use the platform. That ban has resulted in an overbroad, substantial, and disproportionate restriction of an entire community’s freedom of expression, exacerbating distrust and reinforcing biased perceptions.

The Board makes a number of key recommendations for Meta, articulating the need for more clarity and transparency around the platform’s DOI policy, enforcement of that policy, and the use of automated content moderation tools. The Opinion lays out steps for Meta to reverse the ban on the term “shaheed”, update internal guidance provided to moderation teams to make clear that the use of “shaheed” does not violate the company’s policy unless it is also accompanied by signals of violence and still may be important to keep up due to the use of the term in reporting, and to periodically audit the company’s DOI policies and channels. The Opinion also calls for greater transparency to users, which will enable them to know what is and is not permitted, to make more informed decisions about how to use the platform, and to assert their rights should they want to appeal a decision. The Board’s decision, however, is not binding or immediately enforced. Meta has three months to respond.

This decision is in line with the globally-developed Santa Clara Principles, which have long called on companies to take cultural and linguistic context into consideration when developing and enforcing content moderation policies. Comments submitted by over 100 organizations and individuals, including many Arabic-language experts, as part of the development of this Policy Advisory Opinion make clear that there is no direct correlation between all uses of the term “shaheed” and real-world harm. The findings lay bare the company’s incomplete understanding of the ways in which the Arabic-speaking community uses the term. This Opinion will serve as an important milestone if its effect is used to spur greater engagement with language speakers and experts around the world.

The Opinion lays out steps for the company to explain how classifiers and automated tools generate predictions of policy violations and asks the company to assess its classifiers. Such tools are likely to have more shortcomings in languages other than English, particularly in low-resource languages. Low-resource languages are those languages that have fewer high-quality digitized examples of text to train and evaluate models. While Arabic is a medium-resourced language, some dialects of the polyglossic language such as the Arabic spoken in the Maghreb are considered lower-resourced, a dialect we are studying as part of a CDT research project on content moderation systems in the Global South.

Academics have also argued that the Arabic training data used to train automated systems is not representative of how Arabic speakers use the language. For example, if Arabic language training data is machine translated or only depicts the use of the term “shaheed” in contexts of violence, then the model will develop an incomplete understanding of a word used in expansive and multifaceted ways. That, in turn, will lead to Arabic speakers being routinely and disproportionately subject to inconsistent moderation.

Further, without adequate benchmarks across languages, we will never know whether these automated content moderation tools work equitably. Currently, large tech companies tout the performance of their multilingual tools yet disclose in fine print that they are tested on entirely American English prompts or machine-translated ones. (Meta’s XLM-R, for example, is a model the company claims can moderate content in more than 160 languages, but the model is only tested on English and machine-translated benchmarks in a handful of languages.) Both of these are inadequate proxies for gauging multilingual capability especially in context-specific tasks such as content moderation.

CDT has called on companies to invest in digitizing low resource languages, to create evaluation benchmarks for languages other than English, and to work with NLP communities that are experts in language and cultural contexts to do so. Future research and guidance offered by the Board should look into how and whether Meta is taking these steps, including in Arabic across dialects. The Advisory Opinion should also be a call to others in the ecosystem to promote a virtuous cycle of investment in curating datasets of low resource languages, training language models, and building tools.","According to the long-awaited Policy Advisory Opinion published by the Meta Oversight Board last week, it is also the most moderated word on Meta’s platforms.

Its chips and related software power the fastest, highest-resolution graphics and are featured in a line of products that include solutions for all end-market uses. Along with gaming, NVIDIA microchips are used in visualization, datacenter, AI, and autonomous vehicles just to name a few.

NVIDIA was founded in 1993 by three friends and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The company was intended to focus on chips for the budding gaming and entertainment industry that was spawned by the rise of the personal computer and the Internet. At the time of its founding, there were less than 30 graphics-focused independent operators and that figure would more than double over the next few years.

NVIDIA launched its first product in 1995 called the NV1 and paved the way for 3-D games like Sega’s Virtual Fighter. The next big break came in 1996 with the launch of Microsoft DirectX Drivers which changed how Windows interfaced with games. The next year, in 1997, the company will release the world’s first 128-bit 3-D processor. It quickly gains acceptance gaming OEMs and more than 1 million units are shipped the first four months. Later, in 199, the company will invet the GPU and change the world of computing forever. The GPU will not only enhance the graphics capabilities of the PC but lead to accelerated-computing and AI as well. NVIDIA also held its IPO that same year.

4/3/2024 13:23,NVDA,Defense World,"NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Price, News & Analysis","NVIDIA Corporation ranks among the world’s leading microchip manufacturers and is best known for its contributions in the fields of graphics and gaming. Its chips and related software power the fastest, highest-resolution graphics and are featured in a line of products that include solutions for all end-market uses. Along with gaming, NVIDIA microchips are used in visualization, datacenter, AI, and autonomous vehicles just to name a few.

NVIDIA was founded in 1993 by three friends and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The company was intended to focus on chips for the budding gaming and entertainment industry that was spawned by the rise of the personal computer and the Internet. At the time of its founding, there were less than 30 graphics-focused independent operators and that figure would more than double over the next few years.

NVIDIA launched its first product in 1995 called the NV1 and paved the way for 3-D games like Sega’s Virtual Fighter. The next big break came in 1996 with the launch of Microsoft DirectX Drivers which changed how Windows interfaced with games. The next year, in 1997, the company will release the world’s first 128-bit 3-D processor. It quickly gains acceptance gaming OEMs and more than 1 million units are shipped the first four months. Later, in 199, the company will invet the GPU and change the world of computing forever. The GPU will not only enhance the graphics capabilities of the PC but lead to accelerated-computing and AI as well. NVIDIA also held its IPO that same year.

Founders Jensen Huang and Chris Malachowsky are still in leadership positions. Mr. Huang has served as the company’s CEO, president, and board member since the company’s founding. Mr. Malachowsky serves as a member of the company’s executive staff and is a senior technology executive.

Today, NVIDIA Corporation is the only remaining independently operating graphics-focused microchip company in operation. The company’s business has evolved from the core gaming-oriented business to include graphics-oriented computing, and networking solutions in the United States, Taiwan, China, and internationally but gaming is still a pillar of the business.

NVIDIA’s Graphics segment offers GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and software solutions for gaming platforms. The company also offers the Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise-level workstation graphics, the vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing, and entertainment platforms for OEM auto manufacturers, and Omniverse software for 3-D world-building.

NVIDIA’s Compute & Networking segment provides a wide range of solutions for interconnect, AI/autonomous driving, cryptocurrency mining, robotics, Data Center platforms and accelerated computing. Products include Mellanox for networking and interconnect, Jetson for robotics and embedded applications, and AI Enterprise software among others.","NVIDIA Corporation ranks among the world’s leading microchip manufacturers and is best known for its contributions in the fields of graphics and gaming.

To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.

Portfolio Construction

Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of Freeport-McMoRan Inc FCX compared to NVIDIA Corp NVDA.

Note the following:

This article is about the big picture, not individual stocks. The charts of Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) stock and Nvidia (NVDA) stock are being used to illustrate the point.

FCX is a major copper producer.

The chart shows FCX price action in the top pane and NVDA price action in the bottom pane. As a full disclosure, both FCX and NVDA are in The Arora Report ZYX Buy Model Portfolio.

The chart shows that FCX has performed almost 100% better than NVDA for the period shown. This comes as a surprise to most investors. This illustrates the need to properly construct a model portfolio diversified by strategies. The Arora Report uses over 50 different strategies. Constructing a great portfolio is highly complex.

The reason FCX, along with other copper stocks, has done so well is optimism about China’s economy. China is a major copper user.

Purchasing Managers’ Index is a leading indicator. The official data just released from China is positive. A PMI over 50 is considered economic expansion. China’s Manufacturing PMI moved to expansion for the first time since September of last year. Manufacturing PMI in China came at 50.8 vs. 50.1 consensus. Non-Manufacturing PMI came at 53.0 vs. 51.3 consensus.

On Friday when the U.S. market was closed, core PCE came at 0.3% vs. 0.3% consensus. PCE is the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge.

Fed Chair Powell said that the PCE data was inline with his expectations. Powell said that lower interest rates would not be right until the Fed is sure about inflation.

When futures opened on Sunday evening, the momo crowd aggressively bought stock futures and continued to buy them until earlier this morning. The reason is that Wall Street often front runs the blind money.

The blind money is the money that pours into the stock market on the first two days of a new month without any analysis and irrespective of market conditions. Blind money is not price sensitive, i.e., blind money does not care about the price it is paying for the stocks. Most of the blind money is invested in the afternoon. Traders know this and they buy stocks to sell to blind money at a higher price.

Prudent investors should note that today, at least temporarily as of this writing, is a departure from the traditional pattern. As of this writing, the rally in stock futures is fizzling. The reason is that smart money is selling into the strength.

Turkey

There is a surprise in the Turkey elections. Opposition won the municipal elections. This may create opportunities in Turkey. As full disclosure, Turkey is part of The Arora Report ZYX Emerging Model Portfolio.

In the early trade, money flows are positive in Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corp MSFT, and Tesla Inc TSLA.

Protection Band And What To Do Now

It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.

Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.

It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.

Traditional 60/40 Portfolio

Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.

Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.15% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 4, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with a senior software engineer at Nvidia in India who spoke anonymously because he is not authorized to speak to the press. Business Insider has verified his employment and income. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

I joined Nvidia as a newly graduated junior software engineer about three years ago.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

I had other offers from Amazon, LinkedIn, and a startup. I ended up choosing Nvidia because it offered higher total compensation in terms of the base salary and stock options.

Initially, I got around 1.6 million rupees as an annual base salary (about $19,000) and about 2.5 million rupees in stocks vested over four years. Then you get about 25% of the 2.5 million rupees a year in incremental stock grants on top of that, depending on individual and team performance.

I've been promoted to a higher level since I joined and now my base salary is more than 2 million rupees, which is considered a good amount in India. I also thought I'd have greater opportunities to grow at Nvidia than at Amazon, and the work here felt more exciting than at Amazon or LinkedIn.

I knew I would have a good amount of work I could do that would have a lot of impact and that's what I was looking for. I'm happy with my decision because I've been able to do that.

The application process was pretty straightforward. First, there was a coding interview. I was asked questions about data structures and algorithms. Then, I had a call with a Nvidia recruiter, after which I had two technical interviews.

Related stories

I used the online portal to apply and had a referral for the job as my college has multiple alumni working at Nvidia.

Nvidia has eight hierarchy levels for software engineers. The title goes from Individual Contributor (IC) one through eight. As a junior engineer, you join as an IC1.

As a new graduate, you want to get your hands on good offers in the roles that you would like to see yourself working in, so it's best to apply for multiple positions at different firms.

The technical interviews were pretty hard

The best advice I'd give to any tech worker looking to land a similar role at a Big Tech company is to focus on building your data structures and algorithm knowledge. I'd also recommend getting your ""story"" right, so practice how to confidently speak about your experience and how it's relevant to the role you're applying for.

Show interviewers that you have the right experience, and give examples of your past work and how it could fit with the team's goals. For example, rather than just saying I built ""X"", tell them why it was built right. You have to understand the business-use case for every one of your projects.

To help prepare for interviews, cold email people from a firm you are applying to so you can get an understanding of the team culture and what you're getting into. It will help you to make an informed decision if you get multiple offers from different companies.

Use the STAR method to prepare

This method involves speaking about a challenge you've previously overcome in another work setting, so you discuss the Situation, Task, Action, and Result.

Interviewers want to get a feel for how you are as a person, so it's worth feeling comfortable talking about yourself. I once didn't pass an interview with another company for this exact reason. I wasn't well prepared at that point.

Nvidia has a great culture and there's room for failure. They graciously allow you to fail as long as you strive to improve, work hard, and learn from mistakes.

I would probably choose Nvidia again, especially the stock price. My total compensation is much higher than I ever imagined.

4/3/2024 13:23,NVDA,Defense World,"NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Price, News & Analysis","NVIDIA Corporation ranks among the world’s leading microchip manufacturers and is best known for its contributions in the fields of graphics and gaming. Its chips and related software power the fastest, highest-resolution graphics and are featured in a line of products that include solutions for all end-market uses. Along with gaming, NVIDIA microchips are used in visualization, datacenter, AI, and autonomous vehicles just to name a few.

NVIDIA was founded in 1993 by three friends and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The company was intended to focus on chips for the budding gaming and entertainment industry that was spawned by the rise of the personal computer and the Internet. At the time of its founding, there were less than 30 graphics-focused independent operators and that figure would more than double over the next few years.

NVIDIA launched its first product in 1995 called the NV1 and paved the way for 3-D games like Sega’s Virtual Fighter. The next big break came in 1996 with the launch of Microsoft DirectX Drivers which changed how Windows interfaced with games. The next year, in 1997, the company will release the world’s first 128-bit 3-D processor. It quickly gains acceptance gaming OEMs and more than 1 million units are shipped the first four months. Later, in 199, the company will invet the GPU and change the world of computing forever. The GPU will not only enhance the graphics capabilities of the PC but lead to accelerated-computing and AI as well. NVIDIA also held its IPO that same year.

Founders Jensen Huang and Chris Malachowsky are still in leadership positions. Mr. Huang has served as the company’s CEO, president, and board member since the company’s founding. Mr. Malachowsky serves as a member of the company’s executive staff and is a senior technology executive.

Today, NVIDIA Corporation is the only remaining independently operating graphics-focused microchip company in operation. The company’s business has evolved from the core gaming-oriented business to include graphics-oriented computing, and networking solutions in the United States, Taiwan, China, and internationally but gaming is still a pillar of the business.

NVIDIA’s Graphics segment offers GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and software solutions for gaming platforms. The company also offers the Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise-level workstation graphics, the vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing, and entertainment platforms for OEM auto manufacturers, and Omniverse software for 3-D world-building.

NVIDIA’s Compute & Networking segment provides a wide range of solutions for interconnect, AI/autonomous driving, cryptocurrency mining, robotics, Data Center platforms and accelerated computing. Products include Mellanox for networking and interconnect, Jetson for robotics and embedded applications, and AI Enterprise software among others.","NVIDIA Corporation ranks among the world’s leading microchip manufacturers and is best known for its contributions in the fields of graphics and gaming.

4/3/2024 12:24,NVDA,Benzinga,"Better Performer Than Nvidia – Copper Stock Freeport On China Optimism, Front Running Blind Money Fizzles - Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX)","Loading... Loading...

To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today.

Portfolio Construction

Please click here for an enlarged version of the chart of Freeport-McMoRan Inc FCX compared to NVIDIA Corp NVDA.

Note the following:

This article is about the big picture, not individual stocks. The charts of Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) stock and Nvidia (NVDA) stock are being used to illustrate the point.

FCX is a major copper producer.

The chart shows FCX price action in the top pane and NVDA price action in the bottom pane. As a full disclosure, both FCX and NVDA are in The Arora Report ZYX Buy Model Portfolio.

The chart shows that FCX has performed almost 100% better than NVDA for the period shown. This comes as a surprise to most investors. This illustrates the need to properly construct a model portfolio diversified by strategies. The Arora Report uses over 50 different strategies. Constructing a great portfolio is highly complex.

The reason FCX, along with other copper stocks, has done so well is optimism about China’s economy. China is a major copper user.

Purchasing Managers’ Index is a leading indicator. The official data just released from China is positive. A PMI over 50 is considered economic expansion. China’s Manufacturing PMI moved to expansion for the first time since September of last year. Manufacturing PMI in China came at 50.8 vs. 50.1 consensus. Non-Manufacturing PMI came at 53.0 vs. 51.3 consensus.

On Friday when the U.S. market was closed, core PCE came at 0.3% vs. 0.3% consensus. PCE is the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge.

Fed Chair Powell said that the PCE data was inline with his expectations. Powell said that lower interest rates would not be right until the Fed is sure about inflation.

When futures opened on Sunday evening, the momo crowd aggressively bought stock futures and continued to buy them until earlier this morning. The reason is that Wall Street often front runs the blind money.

The blind money is the money that pours into the stock market on the first two days of a new month without any analysis and irrespective of market conditions. Blind money is not price sensitive, i.e., blind money does not care about the price it is paying for the stocks. Most of the blind money is invested in the afternoon. Traders know this and they buy stocks to sell to blind money at a higher price.

Prudent investors should note that today, at least temporarily as of this writing, is a departure from the traditional pattern. As of this writing, the rally in stock futures is fizzling. The reason is that smart money is selling into the strength.

Turkey

There is a surprise in the Turkey elections. Opposition won the municipal elections. This may create opportunities in Turkey. As full disclosure, Turkey is part of The Arora Report ZYX Emerging Model Portfolio.

Protection Band And What To Do Now

It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.

Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.

It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.

Traditional 60/40 Portfolio

Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.

Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.15% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 4, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with a senior software engineer at Nvidia in India who spoke anonymously because he is not authorized to speak to the press. Business Insider has verified his employment and income. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

I joined Nvidia as a newly graduated junior software engineer about three years ago.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

I had other offers from Amazon, LinkedIn, and a startup. I ended up choosing Nvidia because it offered higher total compensation in terms of the base salary and stock options.

Initially, I got around 1.6 million rupees as an annual base salary (about $19,000) and about 2.5 million rupees in stocks vested over four years. Then you get about 25% of the 2.5 million rupees a year in incremental stock grants on top of that, depending on individual and team performance.

I've been promoted to a higher level since I joined and now my base salary is more than 2 million rupees, which is considered a good amount in India. I also thought I'd have greater opportunities to grow at Nvidia than at Amazon, and the work here felt more exciting than at Amazon or LinkedIn.

I knew I would have a good amount of work I could do that would have a lot of impact and that's what I was looking for. I'm happy with my decision because I've been able to do that.

The application process was pretty straightforward. First, there was a coding interview. I was asked questions about data structures and algorithms. Then, I had a call with a Nvidia recruiter, after which I had two technical interviews.

Related stories

I used the online portal to apply and had a referral for the job as my college has multiple alumni working at Nvidia.

Nvidia has eight hierarchy levels for software engineers. The title goes from Individual Contributor (IC) one through eight. As a junior engineer, you join as an IC1.

As a new graduate, you want to get your hands on good offers in the roles that you would like to see yourself working in, so it's best to apply for multiple positions at different firms.

The technical interviews were pretty hard

The best advice I'd give to any tech worker looking to land a similar role at a Big Tech company is to focus on building your data structures and algorithm knowledge. I'd also recommend getting your ""story"" right, so practice how to confidently speak about your experience and how it's relevant to the role you're applying for.

Show interviewers that you have the right experience, and give examples of your past work and how it could fit with the team's goals. For example, rather than just saying I built ""X"", tell them why it was built right. You have to understand the business-use case for every one of your projects.

To help prepare for interviews, cold email people from a firm you are applying to so you can get an understanding of the team culture and what you're getting into. It will help you to make an informed decision if you get multiple offers from different companies.

Use the STAR method to prepare

This method involves speaking about a challenge you've previously overcome in another work setting, so you discuss the Situation, Task, Action, and Result.

Interviewers want to get a feel for how you are as a person, so it's worth feeling comfortable talking about yourself. I once didn't pass an interview with another company for this exact reason. I wasn't well prepared at that point.

Nvidia has a great culture and there's room for failure. They graciously allow you to fail as long as you strive to improve, work hard, and learn from mistakes.

I would probably choose Nvidia again, especially the stock price. My total compensation is much higher than I ever imagined.

The reason FCX, along with other copper stocks, has done so well is optimism about China’s economy. China is a major copper user.

Purchasing Managers’ Index is a leading indicator. The official data just released from China is positive. A PMI over 50 is considered economic expansion. China’s Manufacturing PMI moved to expansion for the first time since September of last year. Manufacturing PMI in China came at 50.8 vs. 50.1 consensus. Non-Manufacturing PMI came at 53.0 vs. 51.3 consensus.

On Friday when the U.S. market was closed, core PCE came at 0.3% vs. 0.3% consensus. PCE is the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge.

Fed Chair Powell said that the PCE data was inline with his expectations. Powell said that lower interest rates would not be right until the Fed is sure about inflation.

When futures opened on Sunday evening, the momo crowd aggressively bought stock futures and continued to buy them until earlier this morning. The reason is that Wall Street often front runs the blind money.

The blind money is the money that pours into the stock market on the first two days of a new month without any analysis and irrespective of market conditions. Blind money is not price sensitive, i.e., blind money does not care about the price it is paying for the stocks. Most of the blind money is invested in the afternoon. Traders know this and they buy stocks to sell to blind money at a higher price.

Prudent investors should note that today, at least temporarily as of this writing, is a departure from the traditional pattern. As of this writing, the rally in stock futures is fizzling. The reason is that smart money is selling into the strength.

Turkey

There is a surprise in the Turkey elections. Opposition won the municipal elections. This may create opportunities in Turkey. As full disclosure, Turkey is part of The Arora Report ZYX Emerging Model Portfolio.

Protection Band And What To Do Now

It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.

Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.

It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.

Traditional 60/40 Portfolio

Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.

Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.15% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 4, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with a senior software engineer at Nvidia in India who spoke anonymously because he is not authorized to speak to the press. Business Insider has verified his employment and income. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

I joined Nvidia as a newly graduated junior software engineer about three years ago.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

I had other offers from Amazon, LinkedIn, and a startup. I ended up choosing Nvidia because it offered higher total compensation in terms of the base salary and stock options.

Initially, I got around 1.6 million rupees as an annual base salary (about $19,000) and about 2.5 million rupees in stocks vested over four years. Then you get about 25% of the 2.5 million rupees a year in incremental stock grants on top of that, depending on individual and team performance.

I've been promoted to a higher level since I joined and now my base salary is more than 2 million rupees, which is considered a good amount in India. I also thought I'd have greater opportunities to grow at Nvidia than at Amazon, and the work here felt more exciting than at Amazon or LinkedIn.

I knew I would have a good amount of work I could do that would have a lot of impact and that's what I was looking for. I'm happy with my decision because I've been able to do that.

The application process was pretty straightforward. First, there was a coding interview. I was asked questions about data structures and algorithms. Then, I had a call with a Nvidia recruiter, after which I had two technical interviews.

Related stories

I used the online portal to apply and had a referral for the job as my college has multiple alumni working at Nvidia.

Nvidia has eight hierarchy levels for software engineers. The title goes from Individual Contributor (IC) one through eight. As a junior engineer, you join as an IC1.

As a new graduate, you want to get your hands on good offers in the roles that you would like to see yourself working in, so it's best to apply for multiple positions at different firms.

The technical interviews were pretty hard

The best advice I'd give to any tech worker looking to land a similar role at a Big Tech company is to focus on building your data structures and algorithm knowledge. I'd also recommend getting your ""story"" right, so practice how to confidently speak about your experience and how it's relevant to the role you're applying for.

Show interviewers that you have the right experience, and give examples of your past work and how it could fit with the team's goals. For example, rather than just saying I built ""X"", tell them why it was built right. You have to understand the business-use case for every one of your projects.

To help prepare for interviews, cold email people from a firm you are applying to so you can get an understanding of the team culture and what you're getting into. It will help you to make an informed decision if you get multiple offers from different companies.

Use the STAR method to prepare

This method involves speaking about a challenge you've previously overcome in another work setting, so you discuss the Situation, Task, Action, and Result.

Interviewers want to get a feel for how you are as a person, so it's worth feeling comfortable talking about yourself. I once didn't pass an interview with another company for this exact reason. I wasn't well prepared at that point.

Nvidia has a great culture and there's room for failure. They graciously allow you to fail as long as you strive to improve, work hard, and learn from mistakes.

I would probably choose Nvidia again, especially the stock price. My total compensation is much higher than I ever imagined.

Its chips and related software power the fastest, highest-resolution graphics and are featured in a line of products that include solutions for all end-market uses. Along with gaming, NVIDIA microchips are used in visualization, datacenter, AI, and autonomous vehicles just to name a few.

NVIDIA was founded in 1993 by three friends and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The company was intended to focus on chips for the budding gaming and entertainment industry that was spawned by the rise of the personal computer and the Internet. At the time of its founding, there were less than 30 graphics-focused independent operators and that figure would more than double over the next few years.

NVIDIA launched its first product in 1995 called the NV1 and paved the way for 3-D games like Sega’s Virtual Fighter. The next big break came in 1996 with the launch of Microsoft DirectX Drivers which changed how Windows interfaced with games. The next year, in 1997, the company will release the world’s first 128-bit 3-D processor. It quickly gains acceptance gaming OEMs and more than 1 million units are shipped the first four months. Later, in 199, the company will invet the GPU and change the world of computing forever. The GPU will not only enhance the graphics capabilities of the PC but lead to accelerated-computing and AI as well. NVIDIA also held its IPO that same year.

Founders Jensen Huang and Chris Malachowsky are still in leadership positions. Mr. Huang has served as the company’s CEO, president, and board member since the company’s founding. Mr. Malachowsky serves as a member of the company’s executive staff and is a senior technology executive.

Today, NVIDIA Corporation is the only remaining independently operating graphics-focused microchip company in operation. The company’s business has evolved from the core gaming-oriented business to include graphics-oriented computing, and networking solutions in the United States, Taiwan, China, and internationally but gaming is still a pillar of the business.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.15% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 4, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.

4/3/2024 7:27,GOOGL,Defense World,"Alphabet (GOOG) Stock Price, News & Analysis","Alphabet Inc. is a holding company formed in 2015 with the restructuring of Google. The move was made to allow the company more flexibility in its business pursuits and to create more transparency in the core Google business. Google, which began as a simple search engine, is now synonymous with the Internet, cloud, and services related to each. Today, Alphabet is the 3rd largest tech company globally and the G in FAANG.

Google began in 1996 as a research project into Internet search. Founders Lary Page and Sergey Brin thought there was a better way to search and rank web pages than simply counting the number of times a keyword was used. The original algorithm was called Page Rank and the system Back Rub but those monickers did not last long. The new system instead determined a page's relevance by analyzing the websites that linked back to it. The more websites with higher rankings linking back to the original site the better.

The original prototype of the Google search engine was launched in 1997. The name Google was chosen because it is a very large number and refers to a large amount of information a Google search can provide. If not for an investment Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, the company may never have incorporated and become the behemoth it is today.

The company grew over the next few years, changed it headquarters to Palo Alto and then began selling ad space. It was he shift to an ad-based and supported model that provided the income and earnings to grow the company to its current size. Advertising still makes up more than 80% of the revenue. In 2000, the company became the default search engine for Yahoo! and then in 2004 Google went public.

At the time of the IPO, company founders and then-CEO Eric Schmidt agreed to work together for the next 20 years. While that did not come to pass, the trio helped get the company on its current path. In the time since the IPO, Google has not only grown to surpass 3 billion daily searches and 1 billion unique monthly active users it has also acquired other businesses to enhance that growth. The two most notable are the acquisition of Youtube (which is included in the ad-generated revenue) and Motorola. The addition of Motorola was strategic in many ways that include the acquisition of intellectual property and better positioning in patent and other disputes with other tech companies.

Alphabet now operates in 3 core segments providing Internet and Internet-based services globally. Those segments are Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets. The Google Services business is the core Google business and includes search, ads, Google Home, and Youtube among others. The Google Cloud segment is a host of cloud-based services for businesses and individuals that include software suites, security, and cloud-based operations. The Other Bets segment includes a variety of applications and services that do not have a direct bearing on the core business and/or are immaterial to revenue on an individual basis.","The move was made to allow the company more flexibility in its business pursuits and to create more transparency in the core Google business.

4/3/2024 7:27,GOOGL,Defense World,"Alphabet (GOOG) Stock Price, News & Analysis","Alphabet Inc. is a holding company formed in 2015 with the restructuring of Google. The move was made to allow the company more flexibility in its business pursuits and to create more transparency in the core Google business. Google, which began as a simple search engine, is now synonymous with the Internet, cloud, and services related to each. Today, Alphabet is the 3rd largest tech company globally and the G in FAANG.

Google began in 1996 as a research project into Internet search. Founders Lary Page and Sergey Brin thought there was a better way to search and rank web pages than simply counting the number of times a keyword was used. The original algorithm was called Page Rank and the system Back Rub but those monickers did not last long. The new system instead determined a page's relevance by analyzing the websites that linked back to it. The more websites with higher rankings linking back to the original site the better.

The original prototype of the Google search engine was launched in 1997. The name Google was chosen because it is a very large number and refers to a large amount of information a Google search can provide. If not for an investment Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, the company may never have incorporated and become the behemoth it is today.

The company grew over the next few years, changed it headquarters to Palo Alto and then began selling ad space. It was he shift to an ad-based and supported model that provided the income and earnings to grow the company to its current size. Advertising still makes up more than 80% of the revenue. In 2000, the company became the default search engine for Yahoo! and then in 2004 Google went public.

At the time of the IPO, company founders and then-CEO Eric Schmidt agreed to work together for the next 20 years. While that did not come to pass, the trio helped get the company on its current path. In the time since the IPO, Google has not only grown to surpass 3 billion daily searches and 1 billion unique monthly active users it has also acquired other businesses to enhance that growth. The two most notable are the acquisition of Youtube (which is included in the ad-generated revenue) and Motorola. The addition of Motorola was strategic in many ways that include the acquisition of intellectual property and better positioning in patent and other disputes with other tech companies.

Alphabet now operates in 3 core segments providing Internet and Internet-based services globally. Those segments are Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets. The Google Services business is the core Google business and includes search, ads, Google Home, and Youtube among others. The Google Cloud segment is a host of cloud-based services for businesses and individuals that include software suites, security, and cloud-based operations. The Other Bets segment includes a variety of applications and services that do not have a direct bearing on the core business and/or are immaterial to revenue on an individual basis.","The move was made to allow the company more flexibility in its business pursuits and to create more transparency in the core Google business.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.15% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 4, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.15% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through March 4, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.

4/3/2024 7:27,GOOGL,Defense World,"Alphabet (GOOG) Stock Price, News & Analysis","Alphabet Inc. is a holding company formed in 2015 with the restructuring of Google. The move was made to allow the company more flexibility in its business pursuits and to create more transparency in the core Google business. Google, which began as a simple search engine, is now synonymous with the Internet, cloud, and services related to each. Today, Alphabet is the 3rd largest tech company globally and the G in FAANG.

Google began in 1996 as a research project into Internet search. Founders Lary Page and Sergey Brin thought there was a better way to search and rank web pages than simply counting the number of times a keyword was used. The original algorithm was called Page Rank and the system Back Rub but those monickers did not last long. The new system instead determined a page's relevance by analyzing the websites that linked back to it. The more websites with higher rankings linking back to the original site the better.

The original prototype of the Google search engine was launched in 1997. The name Google was chosen because it is a very large number and refers to a large amount of information a Google search can provide. If not for an investment Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, the company may never have incorporated and become the behemoth it is today.

The company grew over the next few years, changed it headquarters to Palo Alto and then began selling ad space. It was he shift to an ad-based and supported model that provided the income and earnings to grow the company to its current size. Advertising still makes up more than 80% of the revenue. In 2000, the company became the default search engine for Yahoo! and then in 2004 Google went public.

At the time of the IPO, company founders and then-CEO Eric Schmidt agreed to work together for the next 20 years. While that did not come to pass, the trio helped get the company on its current path. In the time since the IPO, Google has not only grown to surpass 3 billion daily searches and 1 billion unique monthly active users it has also acquired other businesses to enhance that growth. The two most notable are the acquisition of Youtube (which is included in the ad-generated revenue) and Motorola. The addition of Motorola was strategic in many ways that include the acquisition of intellectual property and better positioning in patent and other disputes with other tech companies.

Alphabet now operates in 3 core segments providing Internet and Internet-based services globally. Those segments are Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets. The Google Services business is the core Google business and includes search, ads, Google Home, and Youtube among others. The Google Cloud segment is a host of cloud-based services for businesses and individuals that include software suites, security, and cloud-based operations. The Other Bets segment includes a variety of applications and services that do not have a direct bearing on the core business and/or are immaterial to revenue on an individual basis.","The move was made to allow the company more flexibility in its business pursuits and to create more transparency in the core Google business.

NEW YORK — Amazon is removing Just Walk Out technology from its Amazon Fresh stores as part of an effort to revamp the grocery chain.

The company's well-known technology lets customers pay for items without standing in line and sends them receipts afterwards. Amazon says it will now be replaced by smart carts that allow customers to skip the checkout line but also see their spending in real time.

While redesigning Fresh stores in the past year, Amazon spokesperson Carly Golden said the company heard from customers who enjoy skipping the checkout line but also wanted to view their receipts and savings as they shopped. Golden said the smart carts will give customers these benefits as well as the convenience of skipping the checkout line.

Amazon's decision was first reported by The Information.

Seattle-based Amazon operates dozens of Fresh grocery stores across the country, most of which are in California, Illinois, Virginia and Washington state. The company also operates cashier-free convenience stores under the Amazon Go brand and owns Whole Foods, which it purchased in 2017 for $13.7 billion.

Despite predictions Amazon's entry into the grocery sector would disrupt the market, the company has struggled to find what works.

NEW YORK — Amazon is removing Just Walk Out technology from its Amazon Fresh stores as part of an effort to revamp the grocery chain.

The company's well-known technology lets customers pay for items without standing in line and sends them receipts afterwards. Amazon says it will now be replaced by smart carts that allow customers to skip the checkout line but also see their spending in real time.

While redesigning Fresh stores in the past year, Amazon spokesperson Carly Golden said the company heard from customers who enjoy skipping the checkout line but also wanted to view their receipts and savings as they shopped. Golden said the smart carts will give customers these benefits as well as the convenience of skipping the checkout line.

Amazon's decision was first reported by The Information.

Seattle-based Amazon operates dozens of Fresh grocery stores across the country, most of which are in California, Illinois, Virginia and Washington state. The company also operates cashier-free convenience stores under the Amazon Go brand and owns Whole Foods, which it purchased in 2017 for $13.7 billion.

Despite predictions Amazon's entry into the grocery sector would disrupt the market, the company has struggled to find what works.

In 2023, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his annual letter to shareholders that Amazon was working to find the right formula that will allow it to have a larger impact on physical grocery. The company has shut down some Amazon Fresh and Go stores that weren't living up to their promise and said early last year that it was pausing expansion on Fresh stores.

Amazon Web Services will now allow its free credits program for startups to encompass the use of major AI models from other providers, including Meta, Mistral AI, and Cohere, in addition to its own AI platform Bedrock, the company told Reuters on Tuesday.

The move could attract more AI startup customers to the AWS platform and potentially minimize the cost that those startups incur by using AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated in January that developing the company's most advanced AI model took $100 million.

OpenAI rival Anthropic had to spend half of the revenue it generated in January paying cloud providers like Google and Amazon, according to The Information.

Amazon concluded its $4 billion investment in Anthropic last week, and covers Anthropic's AI models under its free credits program. Anthropic's latest AI model appeared to display ""meta-awareness"" in internal tests.

Amazon stated that it has offered startups more than $6 billion in credits over the past 10 years. The company plans to offer half a million dollars in credits to startups in Y Combinator's latest January cohort, per Reuters.

Amazon isn't the first company to offer free cloud credits for startups. Google is offering up to $350,000 in credits and IBM offers credits in a trial period.

NEW YORK — Amazon is removing Just Walk Out technology from its Amazon Fresh stores as part of an effort to revamp the grocery chain.

The company's well-known technology lets customers pay for items without standing in line and sends them receipts afterwards. Amazon says it will now be replaced by smart carts that allow customers to skip the checkout line but also see their spending in real time.

While redesigning Fresh stores in the past year, Amazon spokesperson Carly Golden said the company heard from customers who enjoy skipping the checkout line but also wanted to view their receipts and savings as they shopped. Golden said the smart carts will give customers these benefits as well as the convenience of skipping the checkout line.

Amazon's decision was first reported by The Information.

Seattle-based Amazon operates dozens of Fresh grocery stores across the country, most of which are in California, Illinois, Virginia and Washington state. The company also operates cashier-free convenience stores under the Amazon Go brand and owns Whole Foods, which it purchased in 2017 for $13.7 billion.

Despite predictions Amazon's entry into the grocery sector would disrupt the market, the company has struggled to find what works.

In 2023, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his annual letter to shareholders that Amazon was working to find the right formula that will allow it to have a larger impact on physical grocery. The company has shut down some Amazon Fresh and Go stores that weren't living up to their promise and said early last year that it was pausing expansion on Fresh stores.

In November, the company reopened three Fresh stores in Los Angeles, California. Golden, the Amazon spokesperson, said the company is now focused on ""selectively"" opening new Fresh stores and remodeling the majority of its existing stores.

Just Walk Out technology will continue to be offered in Amazon Go stores and some smaller Amazon Fresh stores in the U.K., the company said. It will also continue offering the technology to third-party retailers.","Amazon says it is removing Just Walk Out technology from its Fresh grocery storesEnlarge this image toggle caption Matt Rourke/AP Matt Rourke/APNEW YORK — Amazon is removing Just Walk Out technology from its Amazon Fresh stores as part of an effort to revamp the grocery chain.

Amazon Web Services will now allow its free credits program for startups to encompass the use of major AI models from other providers, including Meta, Mistral AI, and Cohere, in addition to its own AI platform Bedrock, the company told Reuters on Tuesday.

The move could attract more AI startup customers to the AWS platform and potentially minimize the cost that those startups incur by using AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated in January that developing the company's most advanced AI model took $100 million.

OpenAI rival Anthropic had to spend half of the revenue it generated in January paying cloud providers like Google and Amazon, according to The Information.

Amazon concluded its $4 billion investment in Anthropic last week, and covers Anthropic's AI models under its free credits program. Anthropic's latest AI model appeared to display ""meta-awareness"" in internal tests.

Amazon stated that it has offered startups more than $6 billion in credits over the past 10 years. The company plans to offer half a million dollars in credits to startups in Y Combinator's latest January cohort, per Reuters.

Amazon isn't the first company to offer free cloud credits for startups. Google is offering up to $350,000 in credits and IBM offers credits in a trial period.

4/3/2024 12:30,AMZN,Benzinga,Amazon To Replace 'Just Walk Out' Checkout Technology With Smart 'Dash Carts' - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN),"Loading... Loading...

Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN grocery stores are phasing out the ""Just Walk Out"" checkout method, according to a report released by The Information on Tuesday. The e-commerce giant is replacing the checkout technology with a “smart-cart” system called Dash Cart.

What To Know: Amazon introduced the Just Walk Out feature in 2016, which allows customers to scan a QR code upon entering the store, select items to purchase and walk out of the store without a formal checkout process. The system uses cameras and sensors combined with a team of remote employees who watch shoppers to identify the items purchased by each customer and complete the transactions accurately.

Several issues have plagued the company’s experimental checkout system, including consumers waiting several hours for the transactions to be finalized and high costs associated with the system of cameras and sensors needed in each location.

Amazon Fresh stores will move to a form of self-checkout called Dash Cart, which uses a scanner and screen embedded in each shopping cart, allowing customers to checkout as they shop. The stores will also install self checkout counters for customers who are not Amazon members.

Amazon will open new Fresh locations with the Dash Cart technology. The company plans to make the switch from Just Walk Out to Dash Carts at most of its existing Amazon Fresh stores over the next 18 months. Amazon will reportedly keep the Just Walk Out technology in a small number of Amazon Fresh stores in the United Kingdom, as well as in some of its Amazon Go convenience stores.

Amazon concluded its $4 billion investment in Anthropic last week, and covers Anthropic's AI models under its free credits program. Anthropic's latest AI model appeared to display ""meta-awareness"" in internal tests.

Amazon stated that it has offered startups more than $6 billion in credits over the past 10 years. The company plans to offer half a million dollars in credits to startups in Y Combinator's latest January cohort, per Reuters.

Amazon isn't the first company to offer free cloud credits for startups. Google is offering up to $350,000 in credits and IBM offers credits in a trial period.

Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN grocery stores are phasing out the ""Just Walk Out"" checkout method, according to a report released by The Information on Tuesday. The e-commerce giant is replacing the checkout technology with a “smart-cart” system called Dash Cart.

What To Know: Amazon introduced the Just Walk Out feature in 2016, which allows customers to scan a QR code upon entering the store, select items to purchase and walk out of the store without a formal checkout process. The system uses cameras and sensors combined with a team of remote employees who watch shoppers to identify the items purchased by each customer and complete the transactions accurately.

Several issues have plagued the company’s experimental checkout system, including consumers waiting several hours for the transactions to be finalized and high costs associated with the system of cameras and sensors needed in each location.

Amazon Fresh stores will move to a form of self-checkout called Dash Cart, which uses a scanner and screen embedded in each shopping cart, allowing customers to checkout as they shop. The stores will also install self checkout counters for customers who are not Amazon members.

Amazon will open new Fresh locations with the Dash Cart technology. The company plans to make the switch from Just Walk Out to Dash Carts at most of its existing Amazon Fresh stores over the next 18 months. Amazon will reportedly keep the Just Walk Out technology in a small number of Amazon Fresh stores in the United Kingdom, as well as in some of its Amazon Go convenience stores.

AMZN Price Action: According to Benzinga Pro, Amazon shares were down 0.28% at $180.47 at the time of publication Tuesday.

Amazon.com Inc. AMZN founder Jeff Bezos encouraged his siblings Mark and Christina to invest $10,000 each in the company in the mid-1990s. Little did any of them know at the time that this would make them billionaires one day.

What Happened: In 1996, Bezos’ siblings each bought 30,000 shares of Amazon for $10,000. Jeff had one condition, though: if Amazon failed and the investment turned sour, he still wanted to be invited to his siblings' homes for Thanksgiving, according to the book “The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon.”

Luckily for Bezos and his siblings, Amazon flourished and turned them all into billionaires. That small $10,000 investment back in 1996 is now worth $1.30 billion, assuming that neither of the Bezos siblings sold any shares so far.

This makes for a staggering gain of 13,025,889%.

According to an analysis by Bloomberg, Mark and Christina Bezos had an estimated investment of $640 million each in July 2018. Based on Amazon's current stock price and accounting for stock splits, bonus shares, and other corporate action, the Bezos siblings' stakes are now worth $1.30 billion.

Bezos’ vision for Amazon, despite the internet’s limited use in the mid-90s, led to the company’s founding in July 1994. He managed to convince his family, despite the high risk, to invest in his venture.

The company went public on May 15, 1997, at $18 per share, and under Bezos’ leadership, it has grown to a market cap of $1.86 trillion.

This investment by Bezos’ siblings is a testament to the potential of visionary entrepreneurship and the digital economy. It also highlights the impact of strategic risk-taking in the rapidly evolving world of technology and commerce.

4/3/2024 8:30,AMZN,WinBuzzer,Amazon’s Strategic Move to Compete in the AI Arena Through Anthropic Partnership,"Amazon has completed the second phase of its investment plan in Anthropic, the emerging competitor to OpenAI, by injecting an additional $2.75 billion into the company. This move, announced in September of the previous year, signifies Amazon’s largest financial commitment to another entity to date. The total investment could reach up to $4 billion, underlining the importance of advanced large language models to the tech giant. Amazon’s decision reflects a strategic effort to position its cloud service, AWS, as a formidable competitor against Microsoft’s OpenAI-powered solutions.

Partnership Dynamics and Competitive Goals

Despite Amazon’s substantial investment, the relationship with Anthropic is structured to ensure Amazon only holds a minority stake, without direct influence on the company’s board. This arrangement is notably influenced by regulatory environments that currently limit large tech acquisitions. In a reciprocal move, Anthropic has agreed to allocate $4 billion towards utilizing AWS over the forthcoming years, mirroring Microsoft’s support for OpenAI. Although, Microsoft does have a non-voting position on OpenAI’s board.

However, Amazon is not solely relying on Anthropic for its AI advancements. Under the leadership of SVP Rohit Prasad, Amazon’s AGI team is ambitiously working to surpass Anthropic’s Claude models with their own development, codenamed Olympus. Olympus is reported to be a large-scale model with hundreds of billions of parameters, showcasing Amazon’s commitment to leading in AI technology.

The Race for AI Dominance

The tech industry is witnessing an intensified race to develop and deploy advanced artificial intelligence models, with large language models at the forefront of this competition. Amazon’s dual approach of investing in Anthropic while also developing its own AI technologies highlights the strategic importance of AI in maintaining and enhancing competitive edge within the cloud services market. As Amazon aims to outperform Anthropic’s models with Olympus, the industry watches closely to see how these developments will shape the future of AI applications and services. The outcome of these efforts could significantly influence the landscape of AI technology and its integration into cloud computing solutions.

Amazon’s multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic, coupled with its internal development efforts, underscores the company’s aggressive pursuit to be at the forefront of AI technology. As the battle for AI supremacy heats up, Amazon’s strategies reflect a broader industry trend where major tech companies are increasingly focusing on AI as a critical area for innovation and growth.","Amazon’s decision reflects a strategic effort to position its cloud service, AWS, as a formidable competitor against Microsoft’s OpenAI-powered solutions.

NEW YORK — Amazon is removing Just Walk Out technology from its Amazon Fresh stores as part of an effort to revamp the grocery chain.

The company's well-known technology lets customers pay for items without standing in line and sends them receipts afterwards. Amazon says it will now be replaced by smart carts that allow customers to skip the checkout line but also see their spending in real time.

While redesigning Fresh stores in the past year, Amazon spokesperson Carly Golden said the company heard from customers who enjoy skipping the checkout line but also wanted to view their receipts and savings as they shopped. Golden said the smart carts will give customers these benefits as well as the convenience of skipping the checkout line.

Amazon's decision was first reported by The Information.

Seattle-based Amazon operates dozens of Fresh grocery stores across the country, most of which are in California, Illinois, Virginia and Washington state. The company also operates cashier-free convenience stores under the Amazon Go brand and owns Whole Foods, which it purchased in 2017 for $13.7 billion.

Despite predictions Amazon's entry into the grocery sector would disrupt the market, the company has struggled to find what works.

In 2023, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in his annual letter to shareholders that Amazon was working to find the right formula that will allow it to have a larger impact on physical grocery. The company has shut down some Amazon Fresh and Go stores that weren't living up to their promise and said early last year that it was pausing expansion on Fresh stores.

In November, the company reopened three Fresh stores in Los Angeles, California. Golden, the Amazon spokesperson, said the company is now focused on ""selectively"" opening new Fresh stores and remodeling the majority of its existing stores.

Just Walk Out technology will continue to be offered in Amazon Go stores and some smaller Amazon Fresh stores in the U.K., the company said. It will also continue offering the technology to third-party retailers.","Amazon says it is removing Just Walk Out technology from its Fresh grocery storesEnlarge this image toggle caption Matt Rourke/AP Matt Rourke/APNEW YORK — Amazon is removing Just Walk Out technology from its Amazon Fresh stores as part of an effort to revamp the grocery chain.

The move could attract more AI startup customers to the AWS platform and potentially minimize the cost that those startups incur by using AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated in January that developing the company's most advanced AI model took $100 million.

OpenAI rival Anthropic had to spend half of the revenue it generated in January paying cloud providers like Google and Amazon, according to The Information.

Amazon stated that it has offered startups more than $6 billion in credits over the past 10 years. The company plans to offer half a million dollars in credits to startups in Y Combinator's latest January cohort, per Reuters.

4/3/2024 12:30,AMZN,Benzinga,Amazon To Replace 'Just Walk Out' Checkout Technology With Smart 'Dash Carts' - Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN),"Loading... Loading...

Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN grocery stores are phasing out the ""Just Walk Out"" checkout method, according to a report released by The Information on Tuesday. The e-commerce giant is replacing the checkout technology with a “smart-cart” system called Dash Cart.

What To Know: Amazon introduced the Just Walk Out feature in 2016, which allows customers to scan a QR code upon entering the store, select items to purchase and walk out of the store without a formal checkout process. The system uses cameras and sensors combined with a team of remote employees who watch shoppers to identify the items purchased by each customer and complete the transactions accurately.

Several issues have plagued the company’s experimental checkout system, including consumers waiting several hours for the transactions to be finalized and high costs associated with the system of cameras and sensors needed in each location.

Amazon Fresh stores will move to a form of self-checkout called Dash Cart, which uses a scanner and screen embedded in each shopping cart, allowing customers to checkout as they shop. The stores will also install self checkout counters for customers who are not Amazon members.

Amazon will open new Fresh locations with the Dash Cart technology. The company plans to make the switch from Just Walk Out to Dash Carts at most of its existing Amazon Fresh stores over the next 18 months. Amazon will reportedly keep the Just Walk Out technology in a small number of Amazon Fresh stores in the United Kingdom, as well as in some of its Amazon Go convenience stores.
