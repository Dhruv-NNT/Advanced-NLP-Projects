        "text": "Happy Saturday, dear readers! The big news on the drone beat this month was the official launch of DJI’s Avata 2, a new FPV drone that’s slicker, more stable, and longer-lasting than the original model released in 2022. That said, I wouldn’t consider it a beginner drone at $999, even if it is noticeably cheaper than its last-gen counterpart. If you are after a true beginner drone, however, the DJI Mini 3 is currently on sale at Amazon and Best Buy with DJI’s screen-equipped RC controller for around $549 ($60 off) — an all-time low.\n\nWhile not as capable as the DJI Mini 4 Pro or even the DJI Mini 3 Pro, the consumer-focused Mini 3 remains an excellent entry-level drone for budding aerial photographers or anyone who is simply drone-curious. The foldable, ultra-portable quadcopter weighs a mere 249 grams (around 8.8 ounces), yet can still handle wind resistance of up to 10.7m/s. Its compact size also means it doesn’t require a permit to fly in the US or abroad, allowing you to achieve up to 38 minutes of flight time without having to file for a permit with regulators like the FCC. Then there’s the onboard 1/1.3-inch camera sensor, which lets you capture video at 4K / 30fps in HDR and shoot stills from 48MP to 12MP in size. It can shoot both portrait and landscape photography as well, in addition to spherical panoramas, all with the help of some pretty effective image and flight stabilization.\n\nIf you’re looking to get more out of the DJI Mini 3, Amazon is also selling it as part of a larger bundle containing a DJI RC-N1 Remote Controller, a Shoulder Bag, a Two-Way Charging Hub, and two extra Intelligent Flight Batteries for $589 ($69 off). Alternatively, you can grab the drone by itself at Amazon and Best Buy for around $419 ($50 off), which is the lowest price to date on the standalone unit.\n\nEarlier this week, Nintendo held an Indie World showcase, providing a brief glimpse at forthcoming titles like Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, SteamWorld Heist II, and a smattering of Apple Arcade ports (some of which are already available on the Nintendo Switch). To coincide with the event, Nintendo also launched its spring Indie Sale, which will let you snag a batch of beloved classics through Tuesday, April 23rd.\n\nMy final callout would have to be Stardew Valley, a wholesome farming simulator that’s on sale right now for $9.99 ($5 off). The 2016 title just received a massive PC update with new festivals and late-game content, and while the long-awaited update 1.6 hasn’t hit the Nintendo Switch as of writing, we’ve been promised it will follow “as soon as possible.”\n\nHades $ 12 $ 25 52 % off $ 12 $ 12 $ 25 52 % off Hades is an excellent roguelike, action-RPG developed by Supergiant Games that was named the Best Indie and Best Action Game at the 2020 Game Awards.

Sadly, the promo only extends to refurbished models — like the first-gen Sonos Beam (now $239) — but it’s not a bad opportunity when you consider that each soundbar comes with the same accessories, documentation, and one-year warranty as new Sonos products.\n\n(now $239) — but it’s not a bad opportunity when you consider that each soundbar comes with the same accessories, documentation, and one-year warranty as new Sonos products.

The four-speed smart air purifier is relatively quiet, particularly at lower speeds, yet it’s pretty effective at picking up pollen, smoke, and other allergens in medium to large-sized rooms.

        "text": "April 22, 2024, is Earth Day. Originally a day to promote awareness of the ways plastics wreck the environment, Earth Day has more recently become a time when all environmental causes are spotlighted because we only have one planet to live on, and it makes sense to try and keep it habitable.\n\nEarth Day is also the time of year when tech companies like to remind us of their commitment to making and selling \"sustainable\" products. However, it seems like they don't understand what that means; sustainable tech is the 21st-century version of the light cigarette. It's still really bad, but not as bad as it could be.\n\nAndroid & Chill (Image credit: Future) One of the web's longest-running tech columns, Android & Chill is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.\n\nI'm not implying that companies shouldn't try to be more environmentally conscious or that every little bit isn't helpful. They should, and it does. I'm talking about the amount of praise companies heap upon themselves for doing the bare minimum and then selling it as something more significant than it is. In other words, they're not really lying, but they're basically lying.\n\nIt's impossible to build a truly sustainable tech product like a smartphone and sell it at a profit.\n\nYou keep using that word ...\n\n(Image credit: imgflip)\n\nSustainable is a strong word that means a few different things. If you look at the definition, you'll see that sustainable means \"able to continue at the same level for a period of time,\" but you'll notice there's a lot more to it than that. Sustainability in manufacturing is defined as \"using methods that do not harm the environment so that natural resources are still available in the future.\"\n\nThis can be true for some parts and assemblies used in tech products like new phones. Copper and aluminum are almost infinitely recyclable, and 100% of the metals used to make phones, tablets, and other products could come from reclaimed material. Plastic is the same way, though it's not a true natural resource.\n\nTwo other important materials used inside the products we love to buy usually get left out of the conversation: cobalt and lithium. Both are materials used in batteries, and until a better way to store energy is developed, both are necessary.\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe thing is, both these materials are also 100% recyclable, and a battery built from completely recycled material is a real thing. No tech companies are even discussing this, though Apple does want to use recycled cobalt within the next few years.\n\nUntil this happens and the new products we buy are built from parts and pieces of the old products we've sent to be recycled, tech products are not sustainable. It doesn't matter how often or how loud company executives try to claim otherwise.\n\nEvery little bit does help\n\n(Image credit: Samsung)\n\nNone of this discounts the effort companies are making when it comes to being more environmentally friendly. Overselling what's being done and using buzzwords that aren't true doesn't mean things aren't much better than they used to be.\n\nSamsung, Apple, HP, Acer, and almost every other company producing consumer electronics are making efforts to use more recycled materials. Just because we haven't reached the point where no newly mined metals and newly produced plastic are being used in construction doesn't negate the real progress being made.\n\nThe actual issue is both simple and complex. It's also the same issue that drives every other decision made by the companies in question: money. Tech companies are businesses and only exist to make a profit for their shareholders. This is why Google kills products and services that aren't making money. This is why phones no longer have a simple 3.5mm headphone jack. It's also why no company makes a phone built using 100% recycled materials.\n\nMoney-saving decisions can be helpful, too. The real reason your new phone doesn't come with a charger in the box is that it makes the packaging smaller. Smaller boxes mean more fit on a pallet which means more fit into a truck or shipping container. Besides saving big on shipping costs, there's no longer a small piece of e-waste inside every new phone box. Win-win.\n\nWhen you get into it though, there is no way a company like Apple or Samsung could afford to be more like Fairphone. It would eat into the bottom line far to deeply.\n\n(Image credit: Fairphone)\n\nNo company builds a product that's as ethically sourced and environmentally friendly as Fairphone, and no company even wants to try.\n\nIt's not hard to figure out why. Fairphone isn't making money. The company only posted profits of €44,000 ($47,000) for 2022 and has very little money in reserve. In contrast, Apple made $170.782 billion and Samsung made $31.5 billion. Billion.\n\nIf you want to make a phone like the Fairphone 5, you're not able to make as many of them and will not make as much profit per unit. For Apple and Samsung shareholders, this isn't \"sustainable,\" so the products these companies sell aren't as \"sustainable.\"\n\nNothing will make the Apple's and Samsung's of the world change before they have to change. Both companies will continue to source raw materials by any means and try to seduce consumers with environmentally friendly measures in areas that don't cut into the bottom line too deeply until the world runs out of those materials.\n\nYou should do your part by recycling tech products and buying used or refurbished items when you can. You should also know that regardless of what they tell you, the companies making consumer tech only care about the environment when it doesn't hurt the bottom line.",

Overselling what's being done and using buzzwords that aren't true doesn't mean things aren't much better than they used to be. This is why phones no longer have a simple 3.5mm headphone jack. It's also why no company makes a phone built using 100% recycled materials. Money-saving decisions can be helpful, too."

In the time since the change of broadcasters, El Clásico featured exclusively on ESPN+. This is perhaps to drive up subscriptions on the platform. However, the Supercopa de España semifinal in early 2022 was on ESPN.\n\nEl Clásico is a major game that pulls in viewers due to the talent on display each time these two meet.\n\nThis contest involves the biggest clubs and biggest players in the world of soccer. Many of the greatest to grace a soccer field feature in this game. For example, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Diego Maradona, Zinedine Zidane, Johan Cruyff and Alfredo Di Stefano are just a handful of players to play in this game’s illustrious history.\n\nEl Clásico’s seemingly unending drama encapsulates, supporters of Los Blancos or the Blaugrana. Or, you could be one of the millions of neutrals just interested in the fixture’s intensity.\n\nEven though the Ronaldo vs. Messi era is in the past, the game still delivers in terms of intensity and importance, regardless of the competition.\n\nThe best way to watch Real Madrid versus Barcelona is through ESPN+.\n\nWatch Real Madrid versus Barcelona on TV\n\nESPN acquired the rights to broadcast Spain’s top flight in 2021, having already held the rights to the Copa del Rey.\n\nIn this deal, ESPN airs the majority of the games featuring the two Spanish giants on ESPN+. That included the first Clásico of the 2022/23 season.\n\nWatch El Clásico on ESPN+:\n\nOur Pick: Includes: Bundesliga, LaLiga, FA Cup, & More Sign Up\n\nThere are instances of the provider placing games on one of the linear channels. For example, the Copa del Rey final from 2020/21 and the 2021/22 season opener, both of which included FC Barcelona, aired on ABC.\n\nWith a game of this magnitude, it makes sense to place the game where most people would be able to see it. However, ESPN+ likely gains subscriptions based solely on people wanting to watch Real Madrid play Barcelona.\n\nLive stream Barcelona vs. Real Madrid\n\nESPN+ is available on practically any platform. For example, iPhone, Androids and phones and tablets access ESPN+ through the ESPN app.\n\nThis also applies to televisions with devices such as Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV or systems such as Xbox and PlayStation.\n\nStreaming offers\n\nAs of late 2023, ESPN+ comes in at a monthly cost of $10.99. There is also an annual subscription available at the sign-up link.\n\nHowever, the Disney bundle takes off a significant chunk of the prices for three related streaming services. At a base price of $14.99 per month, the Disney bundle provides access to ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. There are also increased pricing options for Hulu without ads or Hulu + Live TV, depending on user preferences.\n\nThe Disney bundle provides for the entire family at a largely reduced cost.\n\nWho has won the most El Clásico matches?\n\nEl Clásico is one of the closest derbies in European soccer. Additionally, it is one of the most historic. The fixture goes back to the early years of the 20th century, with clashes in La Liga starting when that competition began in 1928. In addition to being the two most successful clubs in Spain’s history, the match is also set amongst a political backdrop. Barcelona’s strong Catalan identity has often been at odds with that of their rivals (and rival supporters) from the Spanish capital.\n\nOver the rivalry’s history, some of the biggest names of the sport featured in the rivalry. Therefore, the leading scorers on either side are icons of the game.\n\nFor Real Madrid, two players actually take the crown for leading scorer in this stories rivalry. Alfredo di Stefano and Cristiano Ronaldo, legends of the Santiago Bernabeu, both have 18 goals. On Barcelona’s side, Lionel Messi is, unsurprisingly, the all-time leading scorer for the Catalans. His 26 goals leads all players in El Clásico scoring.\n\nMessi also holds the crown for most appearances by a Barcelona player at 45. Interestingly, Real Madrid’s Sergio Ramos also has 45 appearances in this derby.\n\nThe following statistics are specific to fixtures in El Clásico.\n\nWINS DRAWS GOALS Real Madrid 101 52 419 Barcelona 99 52 413\n\nIn recent years, both Barcelona and Real Madrid have gone on runs of form in the derby. Most recently, Barcelona is on a two-game win streak over Los Blancos, coming in the Supercopa de España and the Copa del Rey semifinal first leg.\n\nRecent games\n\nAfter splitting the two first games of the season, Barcelona and Real Madrid drew one another in the Copa del Rey semifinals. The two-legged tie meant the two fierce rivals would play a total of five times in the 2022/23 campaign.\n\nEarlier in the season, Real Madrid dominated Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabeu, winning the first league match between the two of the season, 3-1. After Barcelona got revenge in the Supercopa by the same score, it was Real Madrid’s turn to usurp its rivals.\n\nYet, despite Barcelona missing out on its three top scorers on the season, Real Madrid could not muster any offense of its own. After an own goal from Eder Militao in the first half, the visitors clung to their one-goal lead. Eventually, that was enough to win the first leg. The return leg is not until April 5.\n\nThere is, however, a game in between then in the league, when Real Madrid travels to Camp Nou on March 19.\n\nEl Clásico news and notes\n\nReal Madrid:\n\nBarcelona:",

        "text": "In the late 1990s Joker writer-director Todd Phillips, then applying his trade as an underground documentary filmmaker shot a non-fiction project titled Frat House, which nabbed the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary at Sundance before being promptly acquired by HBO Films.\n\n“The premise of the documentary is that he pledged fraternities at colleges,” John Sloss, producer, founder and CEO of Cinetic Media, told an audience at the Sands Film Festival in St. Andrews, Scotland. He was discussing the pic as part of an onstage Q&A about the current state of documentary filmmaking alongside Molly Thompson, Head of Documentaries and Non-Fiction at Apple TV+, and Oscar-winning producer Melanie Miller (Navalny, Maestra).\n\nSloss had been representing Phillips at the time. Despite the early buzz surrounding the pic, it was never officially released. HBO shelved the project.\n\n“What happened was that a separate chapter of the fraternity he [Phillips] pledged and made look like a bunch of idiots in his film, was the same fraternity that the head of Time Warner’s son belonged to at another college,” Sloss said.\n\nSloss said Sheila Nevins, who was running HBO docs at the time and he described as “one of the great figures in the history of documentary filmmaking,” intervened and put in a call to “kill the documentary” by concocting a story about the credibility of the nonfiction filmmaking.\n\n“It had just won the grand jury prize at Sundance and Sheila manufactured this idea that, wait a minute, the filmmaker is pledging the fraternity, this isn’t real at all. This is shocking. This is not a documentary. But that was the entire premise of the film,” Sloss said.\n\nThe one-hour doc featured now widely reported scenes of ferocious hazing abuses within American college fraternities. Shortly after the Sundance screening, students from Muhlenberg College, where the pic was shot, accused Phillips and his filmmaking team of staging scenes and directing participants.\n\n“They told us exactly what to do,” one student said in an interview at the time. ”They’d call and say, ‘We’re coming in, like, two hours; think of some stuff we could do.’ When it came out as a documentary, I was shocked because [our segment] was all staged. They would retake scenes and everything.”\n\nCircling back to the original audience question about the bridge between nonfiction and fiction in documentary filmmaking, Sloss added: “There are choices made in every frame that slant truth from one version to the next. You have to draw the line somewhere. But the idea that there is a pure version of documentary storytelling is just a pure fallacy.”\n\nThompson added: “The minute you put the camera somewhere you’re leaving out 98% of the picture.”\n\nHBO has still never broadcast Frat House and Phillips, of course, went on to shoot, amongst others, the Hangover movies followed by War Dogs; and, mostly recently, Golden Lion winner Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix. He returns to Gotham this year with Joker: Folie à Deux, a musical with Lady Gaga co-starring with Phoenix.\n\nElsewhere during the hour session, the pair were quizzed on their opinions about the contemporary trend of celebrity-focused documentaries where the subject is given final editorial cut. In recent years, the editorial control of documentaries like, for example, Harry & Meghan on Netflix, sparked much debate around how much editorial control on-screen subjects should be given.\n\n“If you want to see a forgettable film, give the subject final cut,” Thompson said.\n\n“It doesn’t lend to the best filmmaking. On the September Issue, for example, Anna Wintour, one of the most powerful women in the world didn’t have final cut on the film and she wouldn’t have wanted it because she respected the filmmaker.”\n\nThompson added that Apple would never green-light such heavy-handed projects.\n\nThe Sands Film Festival runs until April 21.",

The mine, tucked away on the edge of Lake Naivasha, is operated by a startup called Gridless and consists of a single 500-kilowatt mobile container that, from the outside, looks like a small residential trailer. Backed by Jack Dorsey's Block , Gridless electrifies its machines with a mix of solar power and the stranded, wasted energy from a nearby geothermal site. It's one of six mines run by the company in Kenya, Malawi and Zambia, powered by a mix of renewable inputs and working toward a broader mission of securing and decentralizing the bitcoin network.\n\nGridless runs Gridlesin Hell's Gate operates on geothermal power. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\n\"Most people think about bitcoin and the price of bitcoin and how they can save value in it or maybe spend it,\" Gridless CEO Erik Hersman told CNBC during a visit to the Kenyan mine earlier this year. \"That doesn't happen without the bitcoin miners and us being globally distributed.\" Decentralization is a key feature of bitcoin, because it means the network isn't controlled by any entity and can't be shut down — even if a government disapproves. Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies are created through a process known as proof-of-work, in which miners around the world run high-powered computers that collectively validate transactions and simultaneously create new tokens. The process requires heaps of electricity, leading miners to seek out the cheapest sources of power. While there are more than a dozen publicly traded miners, thousands of smaller, private operations are also competing to process transactions and get paid in new bitcoin. That includes individual miners in countries from Venezuela to Lebanon, and can involve a single mining rig in a kitchen or several hundred thousand of them in an industrial-grade datacenter.\n\nGridless runs a geothermal-powered bitcoin mine in Hell's Gate on the shore of Lake Naivasha. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\nWherever the operation, bitcoin mining is a volatile business, because so much of the economics depends on the price of the cryptocurrency. Since losing 60% of its value in 2022, bitcoin has come roaring back, hitting a record above $73,000 in March, before pulling back a bit in recent weeks. Much of the rally has been tied to the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., as well as optimism surrounding the so-called halving that took place late Friday. That event occurs every four years and is designed to cut the reward for bitcoin miners in half, reducing the pace at which new bitcoins enter the market. Prior halving events have been followed by big run-ups in the cryptocurrency. \"Bitcoin is effectively unbreakable at this point,\" said Adam Sullivan, CEO of Core Scientific , a bitcoin miner based in Texas. \"Bitcoin is at a point where it is more profitable to continue supporting the network than to try and break it.\" Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note on April 18 that they expect the geography of crypto mining to shift after the halving as slimmer profit margins force miners to seek cheaper and more reliable forms of energy. The analysts wrote that the U.S. currently accounts for 40% of mining, with Russia at 20% and China at 15%. \"Latin America, Africa and the Middle East have caught the attention of crypto miners due to their lower energy costs,\" they wrote. Bitfarms, based in Toronto, is now operating in Argentina, while Marathon Digital , headquartered in Florida, has expanded into the United Arab Emirates and Paraguay. Hersman, 48, was raised in Kenya and Sudan, where his parents were linguists. Before getting into bitcoin mining, he and his two co-founders, Philip Walton and Janet Maingi, spent years building internet connectivity infrastructure in rural and urban Africa.\n\nGridless runs bitcoin mines in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia on a mix of renewable energy sources. The company's site in Hell's Gate operates on geothermal power. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\nIn early 2022, the trio began brainstorming creative solutions for the divide between power generation and capacity, and the lack of access to electricity in Africa. They landed on the idea of bitcoin mining, which could potentially solve a big problem for renewable energy developers by taking their stranded power and spreading it to other parts of the continent. In Africa, 43% of the population, or roughly 600 million people, lack access to electricity. Gridless now has eight full-time staffers and manages much of its operations remotely with its software.\n\nTurning lava into bitcoin\n\nHell's Gate is a deep and winding canyon that is home to cheetahs, zebras, and giraffes and rimmed by cliffs, volcanoes and thick bush. The area is covered in ash, and sulfuric plumes of steam will periodically emit from the ground, a reminder of the surrounding, smoldering volcanic craters that wiped out some of the native Maasai tribe in the mid-19th century and threatened others who dared to take up residence there. Gone are the days of fatal eruptions and spewing lava. Instead, an elaborate, labyrinthine piping system and volcanic plugs comprise multiple geothermal power stations.\n\nA drilling hole at the Olkaria geothermal power station in Hell´s Gate National Park.

To make the conditions work for miners, the businesses need the combination of a buy-in from local authorities, cheap and abundant power and some infrastructure, said Nic Carter, founding partner of Castle Island Ventures, which focuses on blockchain investments. \"If you have those three ingredients, it can work, but sometimes, it's the nation state, or a national, state energy company doing it,\" Carter said. He pointed to the Middle East, which is getting into flare gas mining as an example of state-level actors entering the business. \"In some cases, it's with the explicit blessing of the nation state like Bhutan, and then in Texas, it's just with very favorable local regulators and local conditions,\" he said. Africa is home to an estimated 10 terawatts of solar capacity, 350 gigawatts of hydro and another 110 gigawatts of wind. Some of this renewable energy is being harnessed already, but a lot isn't because building the specialized infrastructure to capture it is expensive. Even with 60% of the best solar resources globally, Africa only has 1% of installed solar PV capacity. Enter bitcoin miners. Bitcoin gets a bad rap for the amount of energy it consumes, but it can also help unlock these trapped renewable sources of power. Miners are essentially energy buyers, and co-locating with renewables creates a financial incentive to bolster production. \"As often happens, you'll have an overage of power during the day or even at night, and there's nobody to soak that power up,\" said Hersman. He said his company's 50-kilowatt mining container can \"take up whatever is extra throughout the day.\"\n\nSteam tubes at the Olkaria geothermal power station in Hell´s Gate National Park. Getty Images/Michael Gottschalk\n\n\"Within any second or minute, we are going up and down on a certain number of miners that are running,\" Hersman said. \"It might be down to 50 kilowatts, then up to 300 kilowatts, then down to 200 kilowatts, and then up to another level — and that will happen all day and all night.\" According to the International Energy Agency, in Africa's rural areas, \"where over 80% of the electricity-deprived live, mini-grids and stand-alone systems, mostly solar based, are the most viable solutions.\" Demand from bitcoin miners on these semi-stranded assets is making renewables in Africa economically viable. The power supplier benefits from selling energy that previously had been discarded, while the energy plants will sometimes lower costs for the customer. At one of the Gridless pilot sites in Kenya, the hydro plant dropped the price of power from 35 cents per kilowatt hour to 25 cents per kWh. The buildout of capacity is also electrifying households. Gridless says its sites have powered 1,200 houses in Zambia, 1,800 in Malawi and 5,000 in Kenya. The company's mines also have delivered power for containerized cold storage for local farmers, battery charging stations for electric motorcycles and public WiFi points. \"It's not really sexy,\" Hersman said. \"It's a mining container made from a shipping container. It's got a bunch of dumb machines sitting in it running the same equation over and over again, but it's actually what secures the network.\"",

        "text": "The American Airlines New York flight attendants base is holding an in-person meeting at the TWA Hotel and wow, does the Association of Professional Flight Attendants have a cruel sense of irony. The American Airlines flight attendants union took a boot to the throats of all ex-TWA flight attendants when that airline was acquired by American in 2001.\n\nTWA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2001. It was the third time TWA had filed for bankruptcy. This filing coincided with the announcement of its acquisition by American Airlines. The bankruptcy was part of the plan for American Airlines acquiring the storied carrier.\n\nAnd the role of bankruptcy would become important to how TWA employees would be treated. Since TWA was essentially a failed carrier, legacy American Airlines flight attendants argued that TWA crew should be ‘stapled to the bottom’ of the seniority list. That was bad for their schedules, pay, and retirement.\n\nTWA flight attendants were represented by the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants. They were smaller in number. The majority of flight attendants were ‘sticking it to’ the minority of flight attendants. Unions often work that way, and the airline went along.\n\nThe treatment of TWA flight attendants during the integration into American Airlines following the acquisition ‘shocked the conscience’ of many observers, including legislators. It was a key factor in prompting 2007 passage of the McCaskill-Bond Amendment which now requires that in airline mergers, the integration of seniority lists must be fair and equitable, and it outlines procedures for resolving disputes regarding seniority list integrations in an effort to protect the rights and careers of airline employees in future mergers.\n\nThe US Airways acquisition gave ex-TWA flight attendants another bite at the apple, since it meant another combination of seniority lists. The way it worked was,\n\nFor legacy American:\n\n\n\nAmerican Airlines flight attendants based on date of hire prior to April 10, 2001\n\n\n\nThen TWA flight attendants based on date of hire\n\n\n\nAnd American Airlines flight attendants hired after April 10, 2001\n\nAnd US Airways flight attendants was based on date a crewmember began training (which is about the same as date of hire order).\n\nTWA flight attendants hired in 1972 were placed behind all US Airways and American flight attendants hired before April 10, 2001.\n\nIn February 2023, TWA flight attendants finally lost at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which ruled that they weren’t entitled to seniority they’d lost in 2001.\n\nMcCaskill-Bond required that integration of seniority lists be done in a “fair and equitable manner.” Yet the judge pointed out that ironically this law “did nothing for the very group…whose misfortunes had given it life.”",

But the finale found each of their characters (or a pre-apocalyptic version thereof) confronted with very serious, horrible truths, paving the way for outstanding performances.\n\nIn scenes set before The Bomb, Goggins’ Cooper Howard very begrudgingly used the listening device given to him by Moldaver to eavesdrop on wife Barb, as she attended an important meeting at Vault-Tec, with Bud and bigwigs from corporate allies. Whether taking deep breaths, visibly wincing at what Coop was hearing, or quietly cheering on Barb to do what was right, Goggins conveyed his character’s tremendous anxiety.\n\nBarb, however, would not set her colleagues straight as they debated how to sell vaults for a hypothetically apocalyptic future, proposed ways to use the fallout shelters as “test” labs in success. Instead, she flatly proposed to guarantee results by “dropping the bomb ourselves” — and in that instant, Goggins made us feel the blood drain from a shellshocked Cooper’s body.\n\nLucy’s journey in the finale was similar, as she arrived with Wilzig’s severed head at the Getty Observatory, where Moldaver was waiting with a caged Hank nearby. Lucy spoke about how she considered stuffing a grenade into the artifact, to exact the ultimate revenge against those who kidnapped her dad. Moldaver, though, would proceed to reveal ghastly truths about Hank — namely, his hands-on role in bombing Shady Sands, to which his wife Rose had retreated after discovering his lies and fleeing their Vault.\n\nPurnell, with her super-expressive eyes, reflected Lucy’s disbelief, then horror, as this new version of reality cemented in the heroine’s mind. As she came to realize that the skeletal ghoul seated at Moldaver’s table was, in fact, her mother.\n\nPerhaps the best part of the work done by Goggins and Purnell in the finale is that Lucy’s gut-punch of an epiphany, after which she allied with the Ghoul to, among other things, go find his family, set the stage for a Season 2 we now know we are getting.\n\nScroll down to see who scored Honorable Mention shout-outs this week…",

        "title": "Who Will Succeed Succession as Emmys Darling?",
        "text": "Photo: David M. Russell/HBO/David M. Russell\n\nThis article originally appeared in Gold Rush, a subscriber-only newsletter about the perpetual Hollywood awards race. Sign up here.\n\nWelcome back to Gold Rush, and welcome to Emmy season (such as it is)! We’re going to be covering every step of the TV awards race from here through September’s Emmy Awards, helping to make sense of and have fun with an awards apparatus that has always stood in the tall, slender shadow of Oscar, but which has a lot more moving parts. You’ll never get bored covering the Emmys, if only because there are one thousand categories, each with something like twelve nominees. The Emmys ballot will rival your tax forms for impenetrable length, though it will hopefully exclude the shows from this year that were more painful than being audited (sorry, Secret Invasion and Frasier).\n\nOne thing that doesn’t take an advanced degree in Hollywood to glean is that Emmy voters tend to pick their darlings (shows, performers) and ride them to the end. As a result, nothing is as predictive to future Emmy success as past Emmy success. Which means that when a TV show that has dominated the Emmy ballot for years ends, the subsequent ceremony presents a significant blank space, and a scramble to fill it.\n\nOn the comedy side of things, the end of Ted Lasso frees up real estate in the performer categories. Last year’s nominations for Jason Sudeikis, Phil Dunster, Bret Goldstein, Hannah Waddingham, and Juno Temple in lead and supporting roles will be up for grabs. Though the question of which comedy series will take Ted Lasso’s place has already been answered: The Bear. The Drama categories are another story entirely, where last year Succession not only won six of the seven televised dramatic awards but was nominated for 14 acting awards among the lead, supporting, and guest categories. Interestingly, among the eight series that vied for Outstanding Drama last year, seven (including Succession) aren’t eligible this year, either because they ended (Better Call Saul) or didn’t air a new season, due to the strike or otherwise (Andor, House of the Dragon, The Last of Us, The White Lotus, and Yellowjackets). That leaves only one possible repeat nominee from last year, and… we’ll get to it.\n\nNot to tout the brand name here, but we could quite literally see a gold rush to break into those open spots. Here’s who’s most likely to compete:\n\nThe No-Brainer: The Crown\n\nPhoto: Keith Bernstein/Netflix\n\nThere’s a way to end this conversation and go home early, and that’s to suggest that the sixth and final season of The Crown will get its victory lap, after a year that saw a huge ramp-up in royals drama. In 2021, when Succession took a little extra time between seasons 2 and 3, The Crown was the show that stepped in, winning Outstanding Drama (a first for the show and for Netflix) and five of the six acting categories. Is there any reason to think that won’t happen again? Well, enthusiasm and critical acclaim were both noticeably down for the final season — our own Jackson McHenry found it overly decorous and dramatically unsatisfying as it glided over Diana’s death. And only Elizabeth Debicki (as Diana) has won any kind of major award since the second Crown cast’s reign. That said, it would be a surprise if the likes of Debicki, Imelda Staunton, Dominic West, Lesley Manville, and Jonathan Pryce didn’t at least nab nominations.\n\nThe Hot New Things: The Curse and Mr. and Mrs. Smith\n\nPhoto: David Lee/Prime Video\n\nTo be clear, the Emmys are not the Golden Globes. They don’t just gravitate to the last shiny object dangled in front of them and vote for that. But with so much open space in Drama, some new blood is bound to flow in. Nathan Fielder and Benny Safdie’s The Curse may have confounded some audience members and left others disappointed by its ending, but this was a show that wore its ambition on its sleeve, and Emma Stone is basically a lock for a Best Actress nomination. Over at Prime Video, Mr. and Mrs. Smith was flashy and sexy, and the Emmys were big fans of Donald Glover’s Atlanta, so I’d feel comfortable betting on this new show, too.\n\nThe Camp: The Morning Show and The Gilded Age\n\nPhoto: Alison Cohen Rosa/HBO\n\nSometimes all it takes is for a labor dispute and the end of an awards magnet to open the doors to an era of unprecedented success. Apple’s The Morning Show has always been the beneficiary of a curious degree of awards love, given how any assessment of the show tends to lead with how bonkers it is. Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell have all been bestowed Emmy nominations for their portrayals of UBA morning TV luminaries. Billy Crudup even won in Supporting Actor a few years ago… and honestly he kinda deserved it. In a TV landscape this crowded, star-studded lunacy at least helps a show stand out, especially when the showrunners can make the case that said lunacy is intentional. And yet the show itself has never been nominated for Outstanding Drama Series. Many are predicting that to change this year, apparently on the logic that if we can send Bradley Jackson to outer space, we can squeeze television’s most bonkers “prestige” show into an eight-program lineup.\n\nSignificantly less feted in its first season was HBO’s The Gilded Age, which was unable to to translate creator Julian Fellows’ Downton Abbey awards success into an American context. But this year, its combination of sumptuous costumes and sets plus the finest actors Broadway could spare may well place it above a lot of its competition. As with The Morning Show, it turns out it’s a lot more fun watching theater-trained actors make a meal out of themes of turn-of-the-century social change and the life-or-death stakes of party planning. Do you actually remember the details of international intrigue in The Diplomat, or can you better recall what Carrie Coon was wearing when she stared Donna Murphy straight in the eye and didn’t blink?\n\nThe Genre Fare: Fallout\n\nPhoto: Prime Video\n\nThere was a time when Emmy were notorious for turning up their noses at critically acclaimed genre dramas like Battlestar Galactica and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. But after a decade or more of Game of Thrones, The Mandalorian, WandaVision, and Andor making themselves at home among the Emmy nominees, that snobbery no longer applies. Which is good news for a show like Netflix’s Three Body Problem, which cloaks itself in particle physics but is mostly just an alien-invasion story. Or for Loki, which slumped significantly in its second (and seemingly final) season, but might be able to ride on the fumes of its crackerjack first installment.\n\nThe most likely genre series to benefit from this trend, however, seems to be Amazon Prime’s Fallout. One year after HBO scored a nomination with the high-end video game adaptation The Last of Us, Prime delivers its own video game adaptation, which feels closer to the steampunk/futuretech aesthetic mishmash of a Westworld (appropriate, since Jonathan Nolan is behind this show as well). The reviews have been great, and it’s premiering late enough in the season to get noticed but not so late that it’ll get lost in the crunch of May.\n\nThere’s also the matter of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, the highly acclaimed series which, if nominated, would be only the fourth instance of a Star Trek series getting an Outstanding Drama nod ever, and the first since Star Trek: The Next Generation got nominated in 1994.\n\nThe Apple of It All: Slow Horses\n\nPhoto: Apple TV+\n\nEvery Emmy season takes on some kind of factional concern, whether it’s Netflix and HBO battling back and forth for the overall nomination-count supremacy or Hulu setting records for itself as it did two seasons ago. This year, Apple TV+ appears to be trying to take over the Emmy narrative by sheer numerical domination. I’ve already mentioned The Morning Show. The frankly excellent spy series Slow Horses may finally get its due in its third season. It’s not every day that Colin Farrell headlines a TV series, which puts Sugar into play. Ditto Juliette Binoche, who’s opposite Ben Mendelsohn as Coco Chanel and Christian Dior, respectively, in The New Look. Godzilla is, frankly, so hot right now, which would make the well received Monarch spinoff series not the craziest option. Even shows like Criminal Record and Hijack, which have thus far struggled to differentiate themselves from the pack of thrillers on streaming, boast the likes of Peter Capaldi and Idris Elba, respectively.\n\nBut if you’re thinking that hardly any of these shows previously listed feel like traditional Emmy bait … exactly. The end of Succession plus the effects of the strikes have added up to an incredibly odd Emmy season, especially in drama. (Note for Shōgun fans: yours is a limited series and won’t be competing in the drama categories.) The results will be strange… but potentially very exciting. An uneasy mix of lavish period dramas, irony-pilled provocations, post-nuclear sci-fi, spycraft both sexy and sloppy, and shows that are so bad they come back around to being great — this is a far cry from the Cop Show / Lawyer Show / Doctor Show days of the 1990s. Even if it all ends up being a sweep for The Crown, it’s gonna be a weird ride getting there.",
        "summary": "Photo: David M. Russell/HBO/David M. Russell\n\nThis article originally appeared in Gold Rush, a subscriber-only newsletter about the perpetual Hollywood awards race. We’re going to be covering every step of the TV awards race from here through September’s Emmy Awards, helping to make sense of and have fun with an awards apparatus that has always stood in the tall, slender shadow of Oscar, but which has a lot more moving parts. As a result, nothing is as predictive to future Emmy success as past Emmy success. That leaves only one possible repeat nominee from last year, and… we’ll get to it. Here’s who’s most likely to compete:\n\nThe No-Brainer: The Crown\n\nPhoto: Keith Bernstein/Netflix\n\nThere’s a way to end this conversation and go home early, and that’s to suggest that the sixth and final season of The Crown will get its victory lap, after a year that saw a huge ramp-up in royals drama. In 2021, when Succession took a little extra time between seasons 2 and 3, The Crown was the show that stepped in, winning Outstanding Drama (a first for the show and for Netflix) and five of the six acting categories. And only Elizabeth Debicki (as Diana) has won any kind of major award since the second Crown cast’s reign. They don’t just gravitate to the last shiny object dangled in front of them and vote for that. Billy Crudup even won in Supporting Actor a few years ago… and honestly he kinda deserved it. And yet the show itself has never been nominated for Outstanding Drama Series. The frankly excellent spy series Slow Horses may finally get its due in its third season. The results will be strange… but potentially very exciting."

        "text": "Make a wish! The planets of expansion, Jupiter, and disruption, Uranus, are united in the enriching sign of Taurus to unleash new cycles of creativity, innovation, and rebellion across the collective. The exact connection happens early on Sunday, April 21st, but the changes it represents have been brewing throughout April, for the past 11 months since Jupiter first entered Taurus, and even since Uranus entered Taurus in 2018. This is a culmination moment filled with some of the most powerful astrology of the year, and if you want to take advantage of it, then you’re in luck, because I’ve outlined how to tap into the cosmic magic, based on your rising sign, below.\n\nWhy a Jupiter-Uranus Alignment Is So Extraordinary\n\n\n\nThroughout history, when these two heavenly bodies have come together, we’ve been immersed in groundbreaking eras filled with technological innovations, cultural milestones, and liberation across virtually every field of human experience. Jupiter and Uranus last met up in Aries in 2010–2011, which coincided with the dawn of our modern age of the iPhone , connecting us globally and unlocking answers to nearly every question at the touch of our fingertips. Before then, in 1969, we had a monumental example of the remarkable possibilities this conjunction can deliver when in the same year there was the first human lunar landing , the epic Woodstock festival, and the actual birth of the Internet . More recently, since Jupiter has been slowly making its way towards Uranus in Taurus these past 11 months, we’ve experienced radical breakthroughs across tech, medicine, culture, and more. For example, the Age of AI is officially here with generative tools like ChatGPT terraforming the landscapes of work and education. Movies like Oppenheimer and Dune 2 are revolutionizing what’s possible with storytelling in cinema. We even have the Apple Vision Pro now which, as the first 3D camera, brings spatial reality to life. When it comes to eras characterized by quantum leaps, Jupiter and Uranus are almost always at the heart of it.\n\nMake Magic with the Jupiter-Uranus Conjunction\n\n\n\nThis alignment is rare enough to define a generation but it is also improving our lives on a personal level. The house that Taurus occupies in your chart is the place where unexpected epiphanies and broader horizons are unfolding. Even if things aren’t “changing overnight,” you can still expect to gain a clearer understanding of exactly what it is that will help manifest the future you’re dreaming up. Look for opportunities to say yes to things you might not normally. This is a time to embrace your inner improv artist by saying, “yes, and.” Anything is possible under the influence of this cosmic energy, especially when you wholly believe in yourself, explore pleasure as a portal to your big-picture plans, and dare to defy the beliefs, habits, and fears that block the elevation you crave.\n\nJupiter-Uranus Conjunction Horoscopes by Rising Sign\n\nAries B*tch better have your money! In your 2nd House of Personal Resources, this alignment offers the potential for windfalls of income and a renewed sense of self-worth, especially at work and in relationships. When you put your money where your mouth is, especially in order to overcome any perceived shortcomings, you’ll find your gold at the end of the rainbow.\n\nTaurus “It's the pleasure principle, oh oh oh” - icon, fellow Taurus, Janet Jackson. When it comes to attracting harmony, love, and beautiful things, you’ve got the Midas touch. This alignment lights up your 1st House of the Self, bringing a revitalized vision of yourself into focus. Whether it’s a loving relationship, thriving career, or stable home, anything you desire is possible right now, as long as you let your “freak flag” fly. PS. Mark your calendar for May 23rd, your luckiest day of the year for love and money!\n\nGemini The golden-brick road to your best life is being laid right now while this alignment promotes a healthier relationship with your mental, emotional, and spiritual health. As the tectonic plates of your unconscious shift, take the time to pay extra attention to your dreams and intuition. Powerful epiphanies and developments, especially in matters of love and self-worth, are making themselves known.\n\nCancer Category is: stars, statements, and legends. In your 11th House of Blessings, this alignment is bringing your progressive vision of the future to light. People are eager to celebrate and support you right now so don’t be shy to lean on your network and put yourself out there. Keep your eyes and ears peeled around May 8th too, when the New Moon in Taurus plants powerful seeds for inspired connections.\n\nLeo Savor the sweet taste of success. After putting in months, or likely years, of hard work it’s time to have your cake and eat it too. While this alignment happens in your 10th House of Career, you have the power of the spotlight at your disposal. The projects, opportunities, and reputation you cultivate now have the staying power to last for decades to come, so be intentional with who and what you choose to give your precious attention to. Mark your calendar for May 18th too–luck is on your side.\n\nVirgo The secrets of the universe are being whispered in your ear; are you listening? In your 9th House of Higher Knowledge, this alignment is opening your mind and spirit to the endless possibilities of life. Themes related to foreign travel, philosophy, spirituality, and global media open doors to necessary new perspectives. The only limits to what you can do are the ones that you place on yourself. Dare to dream bigger and believe in yourself while you’re filled with fortitude to face the unknown.\n\nLibra Healing comes in the most surprising ways. This alignment activates your 8th House of Shared Resources, offering profound transformations, especially in your most intimate relationships. It’s an auspicious time to invite collaborators into your inner circle as you invest in your life’s aspirations. Changes in your financial situation, deeply-seated behavioral patterns, and intuitive abilities are all coinciding to conspire in your favor. PS. Mark your calendar for May 23rd, your luckiest day of the year for love and money!\n\nScorpio Love is in the air! You’ve been steadily attracting important partnerships into your orbit over the past year. While this alignment happens in your 7th House of Relationships, your sense of knowing exactly what you want and need in another becomes crystal clear. Whether it’s a renewed commitment or a fresh start with someone new, what’s certain is that prosperity in matters of the heart will be abundant.\n\nSagittarius Nobody knows better than you that the whole point is to live fully—to use all the colors in the crayon box, as RuPaul would say. Since this alignment involves your most important planet, Jupiter, and it’s happening in your 6th House of Living, you’re finding that life is much more beautiful when each day is lived in technicolor. Opportunities, especially at work, abound. You’re playing the long game, and you’re destined to win.\n\nCapricorn Take a chance on a new idea or lover. In your 5th House of Joy, this alignment offers many muses to surprise and delight you. Your creative self-expression is electrified with inspiration, and romance is in the air. The more that you allow your inner child to play freely without judgment or expectation, the more you’ll find that you become a magnet for loving connection.\n\nAquarius In your 4th House of Belonging, this alignment helps you to break all of the rules at home and within family. Your foundations may be shaken up but consider this an invitation to live life more adventurously. Your path is an eccentric one, and as a global citizen, you can sail it with your chosen family. What’s most important now in order to water the roots that allow you to accomplish your great visions is to let yourself feel deeply. Don’t hold back from riding the waves of the emotion ocean.",

        "title": "Is Crossrope’s smart jump rope worth $200?",
        "text": "Like everybody else, my New Year’s resolution was to work out more. After moving to a new city, I fell out of my workout routine, and it didn’t help that the gym chain I belonged to was now a 30-minute drive in Los Angeles traffic.\n\nSo I started researching workouts I could do from home. Jump roping is fun and a great, full-body cardio workout that can also improve agility and coordination. So when I heard the $199 Crossrope AMP Jump Rope Set would quantify the experience and help me incorporate strength training into my routine with its weighted ropes, I was intrigued.\n\nAfter testing the set for a month, I can confirm few jump ropes are as well-made as Crossrope’s, and its workouts and community offer a lot of value for jumping enthusiasts. Yet, at $199, plus a $12 monthly subscription, it’s only for those committed to jumping consistently — not casual users.\n\nThe Crossrope AMP Jump Rope set comes with a set of Bluetooth-connected handles and three different weighted ropes. Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nThe Crossrope system, which has been around since 2013, consists of interchangeable handles, ropes, and ropeless jumping attachments in a variety of weights from three ounces up to five pounds. The AMP set that I tested comes with a set of Bluetooth-connected handles plus quarter-pound, half-pound, and one-pound ropes.\n\nThe ropes and handles are built from strong materials and connect with steel clasps. They feel made to last, but unlike most jump ropes, each rope is a fixed length — you can’t adjust them. They come in six different lengths, but I tripped a few times despite using the size Crossrope recommended for my height. While I began to trip less as I improved as a jumper, when I asked the Crossrope community for help, several members acknowledged they had had the same issue.\n\nCrossrope’s handles feature steel clasps that make swapping out ropes really easy. Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nThe AMP handles are what turn this from an expensive modular jump rope system to an expensive modular smart jump rope system. The Bluetooth-enabled handles connect to iOS and Android devices, allowing you to track jumps, streaks, power output, speed, and calories burned from the companion app. If you connect it with your Apple Watch, you can also import your heart rate data. It’s difficult to judge how accurate these stats were, but Crossrope correctly counted my jumps for the most part, and the other numbers didn’t seem like a stretch.\n\nBut that information comes at a price: $11.99 per month. That’s right: along with forking out $199 for the set (or $99 for the handles if you already have Crossrope ropes), you also have to pay a monthly fee to get any value from the smart handles. Even the jump counter is paywalled. That fact was — and still is — jarring to me and is the biggest downside to the set.\n\nCrossrope’s workouts incorporate other exercises besides jumping, like crunches for those wanting to strengthen their core. Crossrope curates Spotify playlists by beats per minute, which was helpful for when I needed extra motivation.\n\nThat said, you’re not paying just for metrics. Along with a helpful Facebook community of nearly 100,000 people, Crossrope includes an app with over 2,500 workouts created by its personal trainers and on-demand classes taught by instructors popular in the jumping world. Jumping rope is obviously the focus, but the custom workouts also include other exercises like squats and dumbbell lifting. There are also longer programs focused on specific fitness goals, from burning fat in, say, six weeks to improving endurance. If you don’t like any of the options, you can also create your own workout, which was helpful when I required a slower pace.\n\nI appreciated how well thought out the workouts are, with a timer included for each set and rest sessions. Crossrope’s own programs even feature Spotify playlists curated by beats per minute geared for different rope weights and speeds. Unlike, say, Apple Fitness Plus or Fitbit Premium workouts, Crossrope also displays a (weird) 3D avatar of the trainer performing the same exercise in real time, which helps with form. And unlike Apple’s and Fitbit’s programs, you can even message Crossrope’s trainers with questions for a more personalized experience.\n\nWatching a 3D version of Crossrope’s personal trainer exercise in real-time with me was simultaneously helpful and bizarre.\n\nBut we have to address the elephant in the room: the Crossrope AMP costs two hundred dollars, plus $12 a month. It exists in a niche market with little direct competition, but it also exists in a world with a lot of cheaper jump ropes. To pull an example almost at random, the Te-Rich Smart Weighted Jump Rope I found on Amazon costs $17 and has a built-in LCD display with a timer and jump counter, while the YaoYao app also tracks jumps and time and only costs $0.99 per month (or $10 for a one-time unlock). Both also estimate calories burned, and YaoYao also lets you set the length of workouts and rest sessions and compete with others via a leaderboard.\n\nThe Te-Rich Smart Weighted Jump Rope features a built-in LCD display with a timer and jump counter. It also comes in fun colors, like pink. Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nWhile YaoYao often overestimated my jumps, the Te-Rich Smart Weighted Jump Rope’s stats were consistent with Crossrope’s, and sometimes even counted my jumps more accurately. The flimsy 9.8-foot PVC rope tangles easily, but that’s forgivable at this price, especially as the rope is adjustable. The Te-Rich lacks custom workouts, on-demand video classes, and community, but you can find similar ones online. In fact, some on-demand class instructors offer their own YouTube channels. Plus, you can always use the free or paid versions of Crossrope’s app without the AMP handles if you want the workouts and don’t mind losing the jump counter, personalized targets, benchmarks, and leaderboards.\n\nYaoYao thought I jumped 22 times when the real number was closer to 14. Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\n\nThe most effective workout is the one you’re going to stick with. If a smart jump rope with guided workouts and an encouraging community makes it easier for you to exercise consistently, Crossrope is worth it. It’s overpriced, but it’s also smaller and cheaper than other home gym equipment I considered, like treadmills. Crossrope’s 60-day return policy also means you can get your money back if you decide you’re not going to use it enough to justify the expense.",

        "title": "Tom Ultican: The Profit Behind the “Science of Reading” Movement",
        "text": "Tom Ultican, retired teacher in California, smells a scam in the making. The science behind “the Science of Reading” movement is not very scientific, he writes. Publishers and vendors are preparing to cash in on legislative mandates that force reading teachers to use only one method to teach reading despite the lack of evidence for its efficacy. Ultican zeroes in on the role of billionaire Laurene Powell Jobs as one of the key players in promoting SofR.\n\nHe writes:\n\nLaurene Powell Jobs controls Amplify, a kids-at-screens education enterprise. In 2011, she became one of the wealthiest women in the world when her husband, Steve, died. This former Silicon Valley housewife displays the arrogance of wealth, infecting all billionaires. She is now a “philanthropist”, in pursuit of both her concerns and biases. Her care for the environment and climate change are admiral but her anti-public school thinking is a threat to America. Her company, Amplify, sells the antithesis of good education.\n\nI am on Amplify’s mailing list. April third’s new message said,\n\n“What if I told you there’s a way for 95% of your students to read at or near grade level? Maybe you’ve heard the term Science of Reading before, and have wondered what it is and why it matters.”\n\nSpokesperson, Susan Lambert, goes on to disingenuously explain how the Science of Reading (SoR) “refers to the abundance of research illustrating the best way students learn to read.”\n\nThis whopper is followed by a bigger one, stating:\n\n“A shift to a Science of Reading-based curriculum can help give every teacher and student what they need and guarantee literacy success in your school. Tennessee school districts did just that and they are seeing an abundant amount of success from their efforts.”\n\nA shift to SoR-based curriculum is as likely to cause harm as it is to bring literacy success. This was just a used-car salesman style claim. On the other hand, the “abundance of success” in Tennessee is an unadulterated lie. National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) tracks testing over time and is respected for education testing integrity. Tennessee’s NAEP data shows no success “from their efforts.” Their reading scores since 2013 have been down, not a lot but do not demonstrate an “abundance of success”.\n\nNAEP Data Plot 2005 to 2022\n\nAmplify’s Genesis\n\nLarry Berger and Greg Dunn founded Wireless Generation in 2000 to create the software for lessons presented on screens. Ten years later, they sold it to Rupert Murdoch and his News Corporation for $360 million. Berger pocketed $40 million and agreed to stay on as head of curriculum. Wireless Generation was rebranded Amplify and Joel Klein was hired to run it.\n\nMurdoch proposed buying a million I-pads to deliver classroom instruction. However, the Apple operating system was not flexible enough to run the software. The android system developed at Google met their needs. They purchased the Taiwanese-made Asus Tablets, well regarded in the market place but not designed for the rigors of school use. Another issue was that Wireless Generation had not developed curriculum but Murdoch wanted to beat Pearson and Houghton Mifflin to the digital education market place … so they forged ahead.\n\nIn 2012, the corporate plan was rolling along until the wheels came off. In Guilford County, North Carolina, the school district won a Race to the Top grant of $30 million dollars which it used to experiment with digital learning. The district’s plancalled for nearly 17,000 students in 20 middle schools to receive Amplify tablets. When a charger for one of the tablets overheated, the plan was halted. Only two months into the experiment, they found not only had a charger malfunctioned but another 175 chargers had issues and 1500 screens were kid-damaged.\n\nThis was the beginning of the end.\n\nBy August of 2015, News Corporation announced it was exiting the education business. The corporation took a $371 million dollar write-off. The next month, they announced selling Amplify to members of its staff. In the deal orchestrated by Joel Klein, who remained a board member, Larry Berger assumed leadership of the company.\n\nThree months later, Reuters reported that the real buyer was Laurene Powell Jobs. She purchased Amplify through her LLC, the Emerson Collective. In typical Powell Jobs style, no information was available for how much of the company she would personally control.\n\nBecause Emerson Collective is an LLC, it can purchase private companies and is not required to make money details public. However, the Waverley Street Foundation, also known as the Emerson Collective Foundation, is a 501 C3 (EIN: 81-3242506) that must make money transactions public. Waverly Street received their tax exempt status November 9, 2016.\n\nSoR A Sales Scam\n\nThe Amplify email gave me a link to two documents that were supposed to explain SoR: (Navigating the shift to evidence-based literacy instruction 6 takeaways from Amplify’s Science of Reading: The Symposium) and (Change Management Playbook Navigating and sustaining change when implementing a Science of Reading curriculum). Let’s call them Symposium and Navigating.\n\nNavigating tells readers that it helps teachers move away from ineffective legacy practices and start making shifts to evidence-based practices. The claim that “legacy practices” are “ineffective” is not evidence-based. The other assertion that SoR is evidence-based has no peer-reviewed research backing it.\n\nSally Riordan is a Senior Research Fellow at the University College London. In Britain, they have many of the same issues with reading instruction. In her recent research, she noted:\n\n“In 2023, however, researchers at the University of Warwick pointed out something that should have been obvious for some time but has been very much overlooked – that following the evidence is not resulting in the progress we might expect.\n\n“A series of randomised controlled trials, including one looking at how to improve literacy through evidence, have suggested that schools that use methods based on research are not performing better than schools that do not.”\n\nIn Symposium, we see quotes from Kareem Weaver who co-founded Fulcrum in Oakland, California and is its executive director. Weaver also was managing director of the New School Venture Fund, where Powell Jobs served on the board. He works for mostly white billionaires to the detriment of his community. (Page 15)\n\nBoth Symposium and Navigating have the same quote, “Our friends at the Reading League say that instruction based on the Science of Reading ‘will elevate and transform every community, every nation, through the power of literacy.”’\n\nWho is the Reading League and where did they come from?\n\nDr. Maria Murray is the founder and CEO of The Reading League. It seems to have been hatched at the University of Syracuse and State University of New York at Oswego by Murray and Professor Jorene Finn in 2017. That year, they took in $11,044 in contributions (EIN: 81-0820021) and in 2018, another $109,652. Then in 2019, their revenues jumped 20 times to $2,240,707!\n\nJorene Finn worked for Cambria Learning Group and was a LETRS facilitator at Lexia. That means the group had serious connections to the corporate SoR initiative before they began.\n\nWith Amplify’s multiple citations of The Reading League, I speculated that the source of that big money in 2019 might have been Powell Jobs. Her Waverly Street Foundation (AKA Emerson Collective Foundation) only shows one large donation of $95,000,000 in 2019. It went to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation (EIN: 20-5205488), a donor-directed dark money fund.\n\nThere is no way of following that $95 million.\n\nThe Reading League Brain Scan Proving What?\n\nProfessor Paul Thomas of Furman University noted the League’s over-reliance on brain scans and shared:\n\n“Many researchers in neurobiology (e.g., Elliott et al., 2020; Hickok, 2014; Lyon, 2017) have voiced alarming concerns about the validity and preciseness of brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect reliable biomarkers in processes such as reading and in the diagnosis of other mental activity….\n\n“And Mark Seidenberg, a key neuroscientist cited by the “science of reading” movement, offers a serious wcaution about the value of brain research: “Our concern is that although reading science is highly relevant to learning in the classroom setting, it does not yet speak to what to teach, when, how, and for whom at a level that is useful for teachers.”\n\n“Beware The Reading League because it is an advocacy movement that is too often little more than cherry-picking, oversimplification, and a thin veneer for commercial interests in the teaching of reading.”\n\nThe push to implement SoR is a new way to sell what Amplify originally called “personalized learning.”This corporate movement conned legislators, many are co-conspirators, into passing laws forcing schools and teachers to use the SoR-related programs, equipment and testing.\n\nSoR is about economic gain for its purveyors and not science based.\n\nWhen politicians and corporations control education, children and America lose.\n\nTo read an earlier post by Tom Ultican on this topic, see this.",
        "summary": "Tom Ultican, retired teacher in California, smells a scam in the making. In 2011, she became one of the wealthiest women in the world when her husband, Steve, died. Tennessee school districts did just that and they are seeing an abundant amount of success from their efforts.” This was just a used-car salesman style claim. Tennessee’s NAEP data shows no success “from their efforts.” Another issue was that Wireless Generation had not developed curriculum but Murdoch wanted to beat Pearson and Houghton Mifflin to the digital education market place … so they forged ahead. In 2012, the corporate plan was rolling along until the wheels came off. When a charger for one of the tablets overheated, the plan was halted. The corporation took a $371 million dollar write-off. However, the Waverley Street Foundation, also known as the Emerson Collective Foundation, is a 501 C3 (EIN: 81-3242506) that must make money transactions public. SoR A Sales Scam\n\nThe Amplify email gave me a link to two documents that were supposed to explain SoR: (Navigating the shift to evidence-based literacy instruction 6 takeaways from Amplify’s Science of Reading: The Symposium) and (Change Management Playbook Navigating and sustaining change when implementing a Science of Reading curriculum). Sally Riordan is a Senior Research Fellow at the University College London. The Reading League Brain Scan Proving What? “And Mark Seidenberg, a key neuroscientist cited by the “science of reading” movement, offers a serious wcaution about the value of brain research: “Our concern is that although reading science is highly relevant to learning in the classroom setting, it does not yet speak to what to teach, when, how, and for whom at a level that is useful for teachers.” ”This corporate movement conned legislators, many are co-conspirators, into passing laws forcing schools and teachers to use the SoR-related programs, equipment and testing.

        "text": "Pin 2 2 Shares\n\nIT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping, shopping, shopping, often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes, but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?\n\nStephen Procter, a ceramist specializing in art for the garden, has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients, helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.\n\nStephen, who is Vermont-based, has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount, Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together, and how.\n\nRead along as you listen to the April 22, 2024 edition of my public-radio show and podcast using the player below. You can subscribe to all future editions on Apple Podcasts (iTunes) or Spotify (and browse my archive of podcasts here).\n\nsculptural pots in the garden, with stephen procter\n\nMargaret Roach: Hi, Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].\n\nStephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.\n\nMargaret: I know, whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever, friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends, follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels, your pots, and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story, I keep looking around my garden with a different eye, I have to say, thanks to you. So: thanks to you.\n\nStephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.\n\nMargaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots, neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention, what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens, didn’t you? About 20 years ago.\n\nStephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So, so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces, the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny, I’ve been to several pottery events recently, and I don’t really feel like a potter, even though I work in clay.\n\nPeople say potter or pottery, and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel, I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while, I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.\n\nMargaret: [Laughter.] Yeah, they are. They are. So again, I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them, although they do have a hole, a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story, you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of, we’ll say discussion, but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter], about functional ceramics, functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is, whether it’s art or not.\n\nStephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.\n\nMargaret: Yeah, decorative. So yours are decorative, but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?\n\nStephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people, they define spaces, they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level, if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.\n\nMargaret: Well, but I think the garden is, I mean to me, what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating, is it? I mean, hopefully it elevates us and the space.\n\nStephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way, especially it, in a certain sense, reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way, and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.\n\nMargaret: Yeah. Well, when we did the “Times” story, you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens, whose work I’d read, but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it, but it was beautiful.\n\nStephen: Sadly, I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.\n\nMargaret: Right. And so from that, I wrote down one line I remember, “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it, no longer wild.”\n\nStephen: Oh, I love that line.\n\nMargaret: And so there’s that sort of, there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space, and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship, yeah?\n\nStephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts, between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden, which is already cultivated, is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock, where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation, to my mind.\n\nMargaret: Right. Now, I said in the introduction that yours, because they’re this very high-fired stoneware, they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast, just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof, so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration, not just the placement and the scale and so forth, but also the durability. And yours can do that.\n\nStephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference, I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of, as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage, it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.\n\nMargaret: [Laughter.] Yeah, if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words, what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element, a non-plant element of another substance, but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed, and it changing the wilderness, people kind of rise up to it, too, when they see one of these, don’t they [laughter]?\n\nStephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts, and apparently other people do, too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious, and I see that happening and I always feel like, oh, the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.\n\nMargaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play, and how do we figure it out, where to place such a statement.\n\nSo if someone contacts you and says, so I’m thinking I want something, but I don’t know what or where, you sometimes go and go on a walk with them, I guess, or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean, what’s the beginning of that process, of that exploration process?\n\nI mean, I always say one of the most important things about garden design, and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles, is don’t forget, besides walking around outside, don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors, because I’m indoors a lot, right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration, like the placement, not just from the outdoor experience, but from key views within the living space.\n\nStephen: Absolutely, I do. And it can make a big impact, oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space, the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people, I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont, Judith Irven, who was talking about she and her husband, in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter, and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are, and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes, and the wind.\n\nMargaret: And I think some of this people may think, oh, right, I’ve used sometimes a pair of, well-placed chairs, is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow, and especially in the snow, there’s just something so, it’s like, “Ooh, someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.\n\nStephen: Yes, exactly.\n\nMargaret: Yeah, that come hither kind of, but not right now, kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says, I think I want something, but I don’t know what, and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles, you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do, this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?\n\nStephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of, I think, of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another, almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.\n\nAt the inside bend of a path, along a garden pathway, is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter], if you will, as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are, I think of, as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.\n\nAnd then there are more interesting and, I think, more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that, and reveals only part of itself, creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it, sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.\n\nMargaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden, like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting, where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry, and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed, and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.\n\nStephen: Well, exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured, it’s a very geometric herb garden, and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that, and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple, which I think would be a really interesting … I mean, it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.\n\nMargaret: You were just mentioning two pots, and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story, you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element, it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them, even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.\n\nStephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting, and it’s not just my own experience, but people I work with, and when we place pieces in the garden, it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases, this has been a surprising discovery for me, a very relatively small piece, say a globe of 24 inches tall, maybe even a little shorter, if it relates to a larger vessel, it can hold its own in a large space, because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost, if it has a big brother [laughter], it can tag along.\n\nMargaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens, and I think this is a good time, I don’t know, rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at, and I feel like before I get distracted by, oh, those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love, I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned, and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter, so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view, creating almost axial endpoints like, “Ooh, look up there.”\n\nAnd I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do, but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance, but let’s look out there, too.\n\nStephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far, in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.\n\nMargaret: Well, and it’s interesting that you say that, because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years, one of the things they’ve told me when I was like, “Oh, well, I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way, way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard, out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like, “Yes, that’s a great idea. But along the way, maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis, not a literal path but a visual path, maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements, spots of gold, to help you travel there.”\n\nSo that sort of duet again, or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas, I guess, is what I’m saying, come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.\n\nStephen: In a sense, they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another, to another, to another, to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned, a particular palette of plant you’re using, to accomplish a similar thing.\n\nMargaret: You just said choreograph, and you’re giving yourself away, because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?\n\nStephen: Yes, I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely, I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level, very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time, I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.\n\nMargaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these, to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that, and you’re teaching not only, I think, at your place, but elsewhere, including I think, in Europe this year for the first time maybe?\n\nStephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam, and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June, which I’m really looking forward to.\n\nI want to qualify slightly what you said there, Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally, and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years, against my better judgment, I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly, I discover, “Oh my gosh, your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]\n\nMargaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.\n\nStephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there, and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique, and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay, self-taught, and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff, I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.\n\nMargaret: I didn’t ask you yet, but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now, I know that it’s smallish, and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring, summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas, or is there so updates ahead?\n\nStephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter], she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah, I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.\n\nMargaret: And is there any new planting going to go on, or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?\n\nStephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors, and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long, and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent, and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly, we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.\n\nMargaret: And now a third requirement, which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]\n\nWell, I’m so glad to talk to you again, and as I said, I hope that this will just, some of these thoughts from your experience, working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth, will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year, whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you, Stephen.\n\nStephen: Thank you so much.

It's now 15 years old so it's definitely not the original white. We knew we were going to get a dog so we didn’t want to replace it right away though. Well, we rescued a dog that was barely potty trained and she did a number on the carpet. Luckily, the smell didn’t linger, but the stain did. We’ve tried numerous products and none of them helped the stain. The stains are now over a year old.

The flavors mix to simulate the flavors of Dr. Pepper (there is no actual Dr. Pepper soft drink in this recipe). Although we advise extra caution, we’re excited to show you have to make this fun, flaming shot!\n\nRelated: White Tea Shot, Green Tea Shot, Mini Beer Shot, Mexican Candy Shot, Lemon Drop Shot, Scooby Snack Shot, Washington Apple Shot.\n\nIngredients\n\nLager Beer – Choose your favorite lager beer—nothing fancy.\n\n– Choose your favorite lager beer—nothing fancy. Amaretto Liqueur – Gives this drink the Dr. Pepper-like flavor.\n\n– Gives this drink the Dr. Pepper-like flavor. Overproof Rum – Is needed for flaming cocktails. Overproof rum is above 50% alcohol by volume (standard proof rum will not create the desired flame). Look for overproof rum or 151 proof rum.\n\nTo make this recipe, you’ll need a standard shot glass and a nice heavy highball glass or pint glass.\n\nInstructions\n\nFirst, pour beer into a beer glass. Fill a highball or pint glass half full with lager beer. Set aside.\n\nNext, prepare your shot, first by adding the amaretto then adding overproof rum on top of the amaretto. The high-proof rum is needed for flaming cocktails.\n\nNext, use a lighter to ignite the top of the shot. Carefully pick up the shot from the bottom of the shot glass (the top of the glass may be very hot) and drop it into the larger glass.\n\nHistory\n\nThere are two different sources that claim to have created the Flaming Dr. Pepper shot in the 1980s. The Gold Mine Saloon in New Orleans claims to have first created this recipe and also The Ptarmigan Club in Bryan, Texas (this is near Texas A&M University). As is common in cocktail history, it’s hard to know the true origin, so we’ll give them both the credit.\n\nTips for Making\n\nIf you don’t have access to overproof rum, you can still make this shot using regular proof rum (just don’t try to set it on fire—it won’t work). There are a few substitutions for overproof rum. Absinthe and grain alcohol such as Everclear can both create big flames.\n\nSafety tips: Never set things on fire when you’ve already been drinking. Be sure to grab the shot glass from the bottom as the top of the glass is likely very hot. When you drink the completed shot, be careful not to let the shot glass hit your teeth. Always drink responsibly.\n\nIf you want to use actual Dr. Pepper in this recipe, we recommend using it as a chaser after this shot is consumed. You could try substituting the beer for Dr. Pepper, but we haven’t tried it and the outcome is likely to be overly sweet.\n\nMore Dropped Shots (Bomb Shots)\n\nBoilermaker – The original drop-in shot is made by dropping a shot of whiskey or rye into into a lager beer- Boilermaker.\n\n– The original drop-in shot is made by dropping a shot of whiskey or rye into into a lager beer- Boilermaker.

        "title": "5 reasons your Mac might be running slow",
        "text": "If your Mac is running slow, there are a few things you can do to speed it up and better understand what’s slowing it down.\n\nIt’s not just that your Mac is old — although that is an important factor. It could be that you don’t have enough memory, especially if you like to use Google Chrome. You may have a bunch of apps running in the background. There also might be dust in the vents, keeping your Mac from running nice and cool.\n\nCheck out our latest video or keep reading to learn why your Mac is slow and how to speed it up.\n\n\n\nThis post contains affiliate links. Cult of Mac may earn a commission when you use our links to buy items.\n\n5 reasons for a slow Mac\n\n1. Switch from Google Chrome (and other apps) to Safari\n\nSafari is much easier on your Mac than Google Chrome, which is a notorious power drain and memory hog. The more Chrome tabs you have open, the less memory you have available for everything else.\n\nSafari consistently comes out on top of browser speed tests. According to Apple, Safari loads pages up to 50% faster than Chrome. So, switching to Safari from Chrome is an easy way to speed up your slow Mac. (Making the switch also gives you a security boost, especially if you max out Safari’s privacy settings.)\n\nIt’s not just Google Chrome itself, either. Apps like Slack, Discord, Spotify, Microsoft Teams and many others are made using the Chrome browser engine, too. But there’s a solution to this problem: Instead of using the official versions of those apps, you can open them and sign in from Safari, then click File > Add to Dock.\n\nThen you’ll be able to run your web apps in their own windows, just like before, but with the energy-efficient Safari powering them instead.\n\n2. Check what apps are running in the background on your slow Mac\n\nIt’s good to keep an eye on what’s running in the background, especially if your Mac is running slow. It could be that you’ve installed a bunch of apps over the years, and one of them is still churning away in the background even though you never use it.\n\nYou can find this information in System Settings > General > Login Items.\n\nOn top, you’ll see apps that launch automatically when you sign in to your Mac. You can click to select one and click the − button to remove it. Below, you’ll see a list of apps allowed to run in the background. Simply uncheck them to turn them off.\n\nOther background activities are built into macOS itself. There’s no easy way to turn them off without digging into the Terminal, but you should be aware of them:\n\nIf you sync your photo library to your Mac, it’ll download new pictures and videos in the background and scan through them to identify people and pets.\n\nSpotlight, the universal search box that can find files, apps, messages, email and more, occasionally needs to scan your Mac to find if there’s anything new.\n\n3. Your slow Mac is simply too old\n\nMacs last a really, really long time — and that’s both a blessing and a curse. I used my 2015 MacBook Pro for eight years, even as its battery started swelling. Now, it’s probably a fire hazard.\n\nApple releases a major new version of macOS every year. And updating can make an older Mac run slowly. If you keep using an older version (while still installing Apple’s minor security updates), your Mac might run a little faster. (Or, at least, stop getting slower.) Major new releases with new features can slow down an older computer.\n\nToward the end of the period when Apple sold computers with Intel chips — let’s say from 2014 to 2020 — there were some pretty bad Macs. The 2014 to 2018 Mac mini is legitimately one of the worst Macs ever made. If you own one of those, I’m sorry.\n\nThe good news is that new Macs with Apple silicon chips inside are lightning-fast and relatively inexpensive. Walmart sells the M1 MacBook Air for just $699. And if you want to save more with a desktop, you can pick up an M1 Mac mini for around $500.\n\n4. Your Mac is overheating\n\nIf your Mac starts getting warm, it will automatically slow down (aka “throttle”) the processor to keep it from getting too hot. Normally, your Mac will only throttle itself if you’re doing something really intense, like exporting a video. It can be frustrating if your Mac slows down in the middle of your regular work.\n\nIn an older MacBook, the vents can become blocked by dust over time and cause overheating. That’s pretty easy to fix. Carefully unscrew and remove the MacBook’s bottom case. Then use a vacuum cleaner or a can of compressed air to clear out all the visible dust.\n\nIn ordinary usage, it’s rare for a newer MacBook Air with Apple silicon to be pushed to its limits, but it can still happen. Since these laptops doesn’t come with an internal fan, you can boost their performance with a cooling pad.\n\nThis model sold on Amazon costs only $25. When you’re at your desk, you can put your MacBook on top of it. The cooling pad’s fans will keep cool air blowing underneath, where a MacBook Air gets the hottest. This particular cooling pad doubles as a USB hub, so plugging it into your Mac gives you two USB ports as well.\n\n5. You don’t have enough memory (or storage)\n\nMost Macs made in the last 10 years start with just 8GB of memory on the base model. Upgrading to 16GB or more is one of the most important upgrades you can make when buying a Mac, but a lot of people skip it. You can upgrade the RAM on some older Macs, but not on any recent ones running on Apple silicon.\n\nThe bad news is, if you have too many apps open at once, other apps you have open will be pushed out of memory. And that can really make your Mac run slowly if you’re trying to multitask. Short of splurging on extra memory with your next Mac, unfortunately, the only solution when this happens is to quit big apps you’re not using.\n\nThis problem can be compounded if your Mac is running low on storage, too. Usually, when your Mac is running low on memory, background apps will be offloaded into storage — but if you don’t have enough storage, that can cause more problems. Here’s what to do if you need to clear up space on your Mac.\n\nRead more about your Mac\n\nCheck out more Mac tips:",

This week we have some incredible picks for you including a video game-esque workout app, a powerful text-to-speech app, and perhaps the most anticipated and talked about app…ever. You don’t want to miss this!\n\nFitMachine: Legends of Fitness\n\nThis looks more like a video game than a workout app, and maybe that’s the point. Fit Machine: Legends of Fitness offers a fresh take on AI-powered workouts for fast, fun sessions, anytime, anywhere. It’s like having a personal trainer in your pocket. The whole AI thing may sound like a gimmick, but the developers claim it analyzes your performance during each session, and makes adjustments to ensure you’re getting the most out of each workout. Look, either this sort of thing appeals to you, or it doesn’t. If it does, it’s certainly worth checking out.\n\nDownload for free\n\nSpeakLine – Text to Speech\n\nThis isn’t a new app, but it’s one we’ve never covered on here and it’s definitely worth checking out. It’s called SpeakLine, and it’s essentially text-to-speech software that reads anything you type out loud. Obviously, there are tons of apps out there that do this, but there are some major selling points here. SpeakLine has a bunch of voices you can choose from, including funny-sounds and different languages, and you can customize the speed and pitch. The software is also completely free, without ads, and available across Mac, iOS, and even Apple Vision. Remember the movie Blank Check? Yeah, that’s going to be me with this app this weekend.\n\nDownload for free\n\nSuperwhisper\n\nSo the previous app was text-to-speech, and this one is speech-to-text. That’s right, Superwhisper lets you write notes, emails, messages and documents without ever lifting a finger. This is another app that offers something you’ve already seen in a bunch of other applications, but if you haven’t landed on a favorite yet, it’s worth taking for a spin. It uses AI tech for perfect punctation and formatting, allowing you to transcribe your speech into notes 5x faster than the typical speech-to-text app. It supports over 100 languages, and you can export the notes into almost any format. In fact, I wrote this entire post using this app. Okay, so I didn’t, but that would’ve been an awesome line to end on, right?\n\nDownload for free\n\nDelta – Game Emulator\n\nI normally try to avoid mentioning apps or games in this roundup that we’ve already covered elsewhere on iDB, but to be honest, this one was unavoidable. The reality is, if you are looking for a game to play this weekend, there is simply only one title to download: Delta – Game Emulator. For those that missed it, Apple recently amended its App Store rules to allow for emulators, and Delta is by far the most popular. It looks great, it’s compatible with games from NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, and more, and it supports all major console and MFi controllers. As you’d expect, it doesn’t come with any pre-installed games, so you’ll have to add your own ROMs. But once you’ve done that, your weekend entertainment will be set. If you don’t already have a Bluetooth controller, be sure to check out our roundup of the best Bluetooth controllers for iPhone and pick one up.\n\nDownload for free",

        "text": "Are you searching for some new app recommendations for your smartphone? If so, you're in luck because we have compiled a list of the top 5 apps of the week. Whether you enjoy gaming or need useful tools, our editorial team at nextpit has carefully selected and tested five exciting options for both iPhone and Android users. Let's dive in!\n\nThis week we will take a look at a café management game, a useful temporary email app, a habit tracker and journal, and a couple of apps that are meant only for Android devices—a keyboard and an app that relies on gestures to help you navigate a large screen device easily.\n\nMany apps these days include in-app purchases or ads. However, we carefully test all apps to ensure fairness and to protect you from unexpected costs. Our main goal is to find apps that enhance your smartphone experience and provide additional benefits.\n\nIf you're interested in finding app deals, don't forget to explore our selection of free apps of the week! Every week, we showcase a collection of apps that are usually paid but currently available for free as part of a promotional offer. Now, let's dive into our top 5 apps for this week and discover the best mobile games and apps that made the cut!\n\nHappy Dessert Café (Android & iOS)\n\nThere are tons of café management games in abundance, so what makes Happy Dessert Café different from the rest? Well, while this game is still replete with video ads which can be avoided with microtransactions, there is merit to recommending it. It boasts adorable graphics and is well-developed, featuring many areas in the game to keep you occupied.\n\nPrice: Free / Advertising: Yes / In-app purchases: Yes / Account required: No\n\nDo take note that there is no limit on the number of ads you can watch, and watching one will let you earn satisfying rewards. Among them include the energy bar being filled to the brim, doubling the amount of in-game currency you can claim, among others. Ultimately, this game has just one aim: For you to be the best dessert café in town!\n\nDownload HappyDessert Café from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nIt is strangely therapeutic at times, when a lot of the gameplay becomes muscle memory. The kawaii graphics and soothing soundtrack certainly add to the overall charm. What's more, you will be able to unlock a cat café if you progress far enough in the game. What's there not to like about a cat café?\n\nTemp Mail (Android & iOS)\n\nI absolutely detest it when I am required to share my email whenever I want to read an article on a website or use a particular online service. While the terms and conditions tend to promise not to sell my personal details to other third parties, I raise an eyebrow at such claims because not long after, my inbox will be peppered with spam. Enter the Temp Mail app.\n\nThis app allows me to generate instant email addresses that are disposable. In other words, it lives up to its namesake by providing me with temporary email addresses, letting me receive photos and other attachments without having to reveal my real email to all and sundry.\n\nPrice: Free / Advertising: Yes / In-app purchases: Yes ($2.99/week, $7.99/month, $58.99/annual) / Account required: No\n\nTime to hit back at spammers and pesky online sites that want your data! / © nextpit\n\nDownload Temp Mail from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nI have tried using this for a week, and found it to be extremely helpful. While this is anecdotal, I think I have successfully reduced the amount of advertising mails and spam into my inbox thanks to the liberal use of Temp Mail. The random email addresses are simply a mishmash of letters and numbers, but if you want something customizable by editing it, you can do so with a premium account.\n\nI love how Temp Mail allows me to perform autofill in apps and forms as well using this temporary email address. 30 different languages are supported to provide excellent support for users worldwide. You can even generate a QR code for others to scan.\n\nHelloHabit (Android & iOS)\n\nThey say you need to do something for three weeks straight before it becomes a habit. In this fast-paced world, time becomes a premium, and it can be extremely challenging to develop a habit. Thankfully, there are apps like HelloHabit to help the procrastinator out. While this app might be helpful, it could also be considered frustrating. At its core, HelloHabit is a habit-building app that is handy to help remind you to stay on target so that the necessary evils tasks get done.\n\nHelloHabit makes it easier to create habits in a meaningful and easy manner. / © nextpit\n\nPrice: Free / Advertising: No / In-app purchases: Yes ($1.99/month, $9.99/annual) / Account required: No\n\nI love how the developer designed the user interface. It is highly intuitive and effortless to use, which is one of the key ingredients to getting people to use your app. What more for an app that is meant to be used daily. You can select from various views that make it easier to get an overview of how much have you accomplished with each passing week.\n\nThere is only one drawback that I would like to highlight here: the free tier can only track three habits, offering a limited number of journal entries and scheduled events. If you want to gain unlimited access, then there is a subscription fee to fork out.\n\nDownload HelloHabit from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nUnexpected Keyboard (Android)\n\nHow fast are you when it comes to typing with your smartphone keyboard? Well, Unexpected Keyboard will take some getting used to with its rather unusual method of typing. It is simple to use and does not infringe on your privacy, while offering a fairly intuitive manner of accessing symbols and emojis with fewer steps.\n\nHassle-free typing on your smartphone's virtual keyboard with this lightweight and simple app. / © nextpit\n\nPrice: Free / Advertising: None / In-app purchases: None / Account required: No\n\nWhat do I mean by this? You see, there are different symbols/numbers at the corners of certain keys. Slide your thumb toward the corner of said key and the corresponding symbol/number will be typed. As mentioned earlier, there is a slight learning curve to using this keyboard, but I believe you will be messaging like a boss in no time at all.\n\nDownload Unexpected Keyboard from the Google Play Store.\n\nHere's a word of caution for those who have long gotten used to Gboard and/or Swiftkey. This app will most probably find niche users due to the limited functionality. For starters, it has no autocomplete, it misses out on a clipboard that allows you to copy and paste, and there is a lack of theme support. Thankfully, in terms of security, it works for me since there is no need to be connected to the Internet to use it and asks for only two permissions on my device.\n\nMicro Gesture (Android)\n\nI wonder just how much of Pavlov's principle have we humans attuned ourselves to when it comes to using our smartphones. What if I told you there is a brand-new way to use your handset? Imagine being able to access your favorite app simply by pressing the Volume Up or Power button.\n\nWhat if you have incoming notifications that you want to view? Just tilt the handset to the left, and the notification pane will drop. This is precisely what Micro Gesture does—offer you a whole new way of interacting with your smartphone.\n\nPrice: Free / Advertising: No / In-app purchases: No / Account required: No\n\nYou will find yourself using your smartphone like a boss with these built-in scripted gestures! / © nextpit\n\nAs smartphones get larger, using it with just a single hand becomes more and more difficult. In fact, it is downright impossible for some people, considering the heft of the device itself. Still, there are some handsets out there that can be operated with just one hand, so why not make use of Micro Gesture to help you make the most of it?\n\nDownload Micro Gesture from the Google Play Store.\n\nThis app relies on your handset's gyroscopes to recognize minute movements, improving the operating experience of large-screen smartphones. You can rotate the phone along three axes and assign a customizable action to each axis. It is highly customizable with an adjustable motion sensitivity slider, offering optional vibration or text feedback to boot. When you're more comfortable with it, feel free to explore the different automated scripts for a more productive user experience.\n\nDid you discover an exciting new app this week? If so, why not let us know and share it with the nextpit community? You can do so in the comments!",

        "text": "There are more digital subscriptions around than ever, and among them, you may well have a music streaming service (or two or three). What with “free” trials and trying to find a service you really like, it’s easy to suddenly realize you’re oversubscribed. Luckily, canceling a music subscription — or switching to a free tier — isn’t too difficult. And remember that you can always sign up again. It doesn’t have to be goodbye forever.\n\nHere’s how it’s done on the four best-known platforms. The options will be similar on other services.\n\nSpotify has a variety of plans for individuals, families, and even two people.\n\nSpotify has a free tier with ads, without downloads, and with limits on playlists, while the individual Premium plan is $10.99 per month. If you have other people you can sign up with, you can get a Duo plan (two people) for $14.99 per month and a Family plan (up to six people) for $16.99 per month. Students get a discount at $5.99 a month.\n\nTo change the plan you’re on via the Spotify web app:\n\nClick your profile picture (top right).\n\nChoose Account .\n\n. Click Manage your plan > Change plan .\n\n. Pick the plan you want to switch to.\n\nYou can get to the same screens in the mobile app by tapping your profile picture (top left), Settings and privacy > Account, and then the name of your current plan.\n\nTo close your Spotify account completely, you need to head to this page and follow the link.\n\nYou can manage Apple Music subscriptions on the web.\n\nApple Music costs $10.99 per month for an individual plan and $16.99 per month for a Family plan (for up to six people); students can get it for $5.99 per month. There’s also Apple One, which bundles various Apple services together including Apple Music; those bundles start at $19.95 per month. There’s no free tier for Apple Music cloud streaming, though you can use the free Apple Music app to listen to digital music files stored on your devices.\n\nTo change your Apple Music subscription on an iPhone:\n\nOpen Settings on iOS.\n\nTap your name at the top.\n\nChoose Subscriptions > Apple Music .\n\n. Tap See All Plans to switch plans or Cancel Subscription to cancel.\n\nIf you’re signed up to Apple One, you’ll see slightly different options. You’ll be able to see the individual subscriptions included in your package and unsubscribe from them one by one or cancel the entire subscription.\n\nThe same options to switch plans or cancel can be found on macOS:\n\nOpen the App Store.\n\nClick your name (bottom left).\n\nChoose Account Settings > Manage (next to subscriptions).\n\n(next to subscriptions). Click Edit to make changes.\n\nOn Apple Music on the web, click your profile picture (top right) and then Settings and Manage to edit your subscription status. On Android, tap the three dots (top right), then Account > Manage Subscription.\n\nYour Amazon Music settings are tied to your Amazon account.\n\nThere are three tiers to Amazon Music: the free tier that comes with every Amazon account; the Prime tier that comes with an Amazon Prime subscription ($14.99 per month); and Amazon Music Unlimited ($10.99 per month or $9.99 per month if you already pay for Prime). There’s also a Family plan for Amazon Music Unlimited, which is $16.99 per month for up to six people (and the head of the family must have Amazon Prime).\n\nStill with us? These different tiers offer different features, including whether you get ads between songs, audio quality, the ability to download tracks, and the number of devices you can listen on.\n\nTo cancel an Amazon Music Unlimited or Prime subscription on the web:\n\nClick the gear icon (top right).\n\nChoose Your Amazon Music Settings .\n\n. You get the choice to switch between individual or Family plans if you want to.\n\nClick Cancel Subscription to do just that.\n\nto do just that. To unsubscribe from Amazon Prime, choose Manage your Prime membership.\n\nThese same options aren’t available through the mobile apps — you need to access them through a web browser to manage or cancel your various subscriptions.\n\nIf you want, you can put a temporary pause on your YouTube Music sub instead of canceling it.\n\nYouTube Music is available as both an ad-supported free tier with no support for downloads and a Premium tier that’ll set you back $10.99 per month or $109.99 a year. A Family plan for $16.99 per month is also available, which covers up to six people; a plan for students costs $5.49 per month. YouTube Music Premium also comes included with YouTube Premium, which is $13.99 per month.\n\nTo manage your YouTube Music account on the web:\n\nClick your profile picture (top left) and then Paid memberships (or Get Music Premium if you’re on the free plan and want to upgrade).\n\n(or if you’re on the free plan and want to upgrade). Select Manage membership and select your subscription.\n\nand select your subscription. Choose Pause if you want to pause the membership for up to six months.\n\nif you want to pause the membership for up to six months. Click Cancel to stop the subscription.",

        "text": "We write about the best phones on a daily basis here at TechRadar, but rarely do we take a moment to consider the accessories – think cases, chargers and adapters – that make these products even better.\n\nI’ve made no secret of my preference for iPhone over Android, so in this article, I thought I’d share the three iPhone accessories I use alongside my iPhone 15 Pro to get the best out of what is, for me, the best iPhone Apple has ever released (in the coming weeks, we’ll post an Android-equivalent version of this same format).\n\nIncidentally, all three products in the below list are available to purchase from Apple directly, but where possible, you’ll also see links to cheaper, third-party retailers in the US, UK and Australia underneath each listing.\n\nApple MagSafe Charger\n\n(Image credit: Apple / Future)\n\nI was skeptical about the benefits of MagSafe charging at first – after all, having a magnetic charger clipped to the back of your phone effectively makes the whole 'wireless' thing redundant – but Apple’s official MagSafe Charger is absolutely worth the $39 / £45 / AU$69 outlay, for convenience alone.\n\nIf you’ve got an iPhone 12 or later, this neat-looking disc will charge your device up to 15W, and you’ll never need to worry about owning the correct charging cable again (if you move from a Lightning-equipped iPhone 12 to a USB-C-equipped iPhone 15, for instance, you won’t have to reinvest in a new charger).\n\nWhat’s more, Apple’s MagSafe Charger can juice up the wireless charging case used to power AirPods, so if, like me, you own an iPhone 15 (USB-C) and the old-generation AirPods (Lightning), this is still a one-fits-all charging solution.\n\nFor the latest Apple MagSafe Charger prices in your region, check out the price comparison block below. And if you’re still not convinced about the benefits of MagSafe, head over to our best iPhone chargers guide for a look at the alternative options.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Get the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nApple iPhone FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe\n\n(Image credit: Apple)\n\nSticking with the MagSafe theme, Apple’s MagSafe wallet is another of the best MagSafe accessories available in 2024. I actually own the now-discontinued leather version of this product, which has held up remarkably well despite its age, but since that MagSafe wallet was replaced by a FineWoven version in 2023, this is your best bet if you’re looking for a way to keep your cards safe and sound without needing to lug around an actual wallet.\n\nYes, it’s true that Apple’s new FineWoven material hasn’t gone down well with customers who bought its FineWoven phone cases, but the FineWoven MagSafe Wallet is at least compatible with the company’s Find My network (the first-generation leather version wasn’t, and only a few third-party MagSafe wallets are Find My-compatible in 2024). Essentially, that means you’ll be able to track and locate your wallet, should you misplace it.\n\nThe FineWoven MagSafe Wallet supports up to three cards, and can be stacked on top of a MagSafe-compatible iPhone case, so you needn't sacrifice protection for convenience. Again, some third-party alternatives also offer this functionality, but I haven’t tried them out for myself, so I can only attest to the practicality of Apple’s version.\n\nFor the latest Apple FineWoven MagSafe Wallet prices in your region, check out the price comparison block below.\n\nApple AirTag\n\n(Image credit: Apple)\n\nOkay, this one isn’t strictly an iPhone accessory, per se, but if you haven’t yet invested in an Apple AirTag, you’re missing out on some serious peace of mind.\n\nIn today’s mile-a-minute world, it can be easy to lose track of the small things – and I mean that literally, as well as metaphorically. Apple AirTags are a great way to keep tabs on the whereabouts of your seemingly anthropomorphic keys, wallet or suitcase from the convenience of your iPhone, and although their $29 / £35 / AU$49 asking price seems steep, you’ll be thankful for the investment when you realize that your baggage did not, in fact, make it onto the plane at Doha airport.\n\nIf you're partial to losing multiple important things at any one time (and let's face it, who isn't?), Apple (and indeed most third-party retailers) also offers an AirTag four-pack for $99 / £119 / AU$165, which is slightly better value. For the latest Apple AirTag prices in your region, check out the price comparison block below.",

        "text": "Jack Nicholson and Denzel Washington at the Lakers. Jay-Z and Beyoncé rooting for the Nets. Bad Bunny, well, everywhere. Seating celebrities courtside is downright de rigueur in the modern NBA, but you don’t have to be an A-lister to relish the royal treatment at today’s games. America’s premier arenas offer high-rolling sports fans stylishly indulgent experiences that go beyond covetable tickets to include hidden enclaves, gourmet cuisine, collector-worthy wine lists, and, in at least one case, all the candy you can eat.\n\nWho needs onion rings? The Crown Club at Barclays Center serves Nicoise salad and steak frites. Sinna Nasseri\n\nWhile the Brooklyn Nets didn’t exactly set the league ablaze this season, the VIP program at the team’s home court, the Barclays Center, rivals any in the Association. Members of the Courtside Crown Club enter through a private tunnel, from which they can enjoy a bird’s-eye view of the players’ practice court below. Nestled at court level is the club itself, accessible only to 218 season-ticket holders. Conceived by Major Food Group—the culinary operation behind New York’s hottest reservation, Carbone, and the members-only ZZ’s Club—the restaurant blends Japanese design elements, moody lighting, and a plethora of large-screen TVs. Its rotating menu offers Carbone signatures (yes, even the viral Spicy Rigatoni Vodka) while an 800-bottle wine list caters to proper oenophiles: Here, you can pregame over a 2009 La Romanée-Conti, a Ridge from 1994, or even a ’45 Haut-Brion. But the most decadent offering may be the sweets room, a whimsical candy-apple-red wonderland with a buffet of nostalgic treats: Think Milk Duds, Twizzlers, Sour Patch Kids, Charleston Chews, and more. There’s even gelato on tap.\n\nThe Crown Club’s stylish “sweets room” is a buffet of nostalgic grab-and-go treats. Sinna Nasseri\n\nOf course, the seats are no slouches, either. A brief walk from the Crown Club leads you to front-row folding leather chairs on the wood. From here, you’ll know what the Carters know—that everything about the game is bigger and grander at courtside.\n\nTwelve hundred miles south, in Miami, the Heat’s Kaseya Center delivers a VIP experience with decidedly South Beach flair. Heat Elite Courtside members watch the game from prime position on the hardwood, alongside superfans Pitbull and Rick Ross. For $150,000 annually (the going rate according to multiple sources), you also get access to two private lounges, one on either side of the arena, just a short walk from your seats.\n\nKaseya Center’s private South Lounge added Black Angus Ribeye to the menu for a game in early March. SINNA NASSERI\n\nThe lounges double as upscale eateries, serving bistro-style menus with Latin American twists—burgers and wild Atlantic salmon are complemented by grilled churrasco steak and Cuban sandwiches. Throughout the season, a rotating cast of notable chefs, including Michelin-starred David Shim and James Beard Award winner Michelle Bernstein, add their own culinary magic to the mix.\n\nMeanwhile, the Courtside Club may be the most hopping space in the venue. Built in a converted locker room beneath the bleachers, the club feels like a nightlife hot spot, complete with a DJ spinning in a booth overlooking the bar. Under the glow of neon lights—and a large sign in homage to the Notorious B.I.G. that reads “It was all a dream”—members sip cocktails and nosh on Peruvian Japanese–style small bites (made by chefs from the local eatery B-Side by Itamae) in sleek black-leather booths. Think of it as the VIP version of the team’s famed Heat Culture.\n\nA decommissioned locker room at Kaseya Center is host to the Heat’s Courtside Club, a thumping bar that rivals some South Beach nightlife hot spots. Sinna Nasseri\n\nNot to be upstaged by their East Coast rivals, San Francisco’s Chase Center and L.A.’s Crypto.com Arena embrace the notion that games are more luxurious when enjoyed with your crew. The California arenas’ most opulent experiences take place in lounges and suites that feel more like modern condos—and come with the best seats in the house.\n\nHome to Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors, Chase Center pairs its basketball with Napa Valley sophistication. Nods to wine country abound throughout the arena. The 32 Courtside Lounges, the Center’s most exclusive VIP offering, are reserved on long-term leases for what its PR team calls “an annual seven-figure commitment.” The suites are configured around two wine vaults—one on each side of the arena—that source bottles from local producers, including Frog’s Leap and Silver Oak.\n\nChase Center’s Courtside Lounges have massive screens that overlook the court from three rows up. Sinna Nasseri\n\nInside, a vaulted ceiling inspired by wine barrels arcs over a sand-colored room furnished with marble-topped tables and comfy chairs and sofas. You and up to 11 friends can savor farm-to-table cuisine, and an additional four guests can join you to watch the action via a massive screen that frames the game like a window from three rows up. And if you’re ready to uncork that 2005 Petrus you’ve been saving for a special occasion, the arena has you covered: Each lounge comes equipped with its own refrigerated wine storage.\n\nA young Warriors fan gets a sundae delivered on a silver platter at the Chase Center in San Francisco, CA during a game between the Golden State Warriors and Denver Nuggets on Feb 25, 2024. SINNA NASSERI\n\nL.A. is all about the grand entrance, and Crypto.com Arena is no exception. Members of its Tunnel Suites program are treated to a VIP experience from the moment they arrive—at the same underground parking lot the athletes themselves use. (The arena is home to the Lakers, the Clippers, the WNBA’s Sparks, and the NHL’s Kings.) For a multiyear lease in the low seven figures annually, a valet will whisk away your car as you undertake your own tunnel walk (designer kicks optional), trodding the same path as LeBron James, James Harden, and Anže Kopitar. Upon arrival, you’ll be greeted at a private entrance with a glass of wine or a cocktail of your choice. Then it’s off to one of four tunnel suites handsomely appointed with leather sofas, velvet bar seats, and the requisite large-screen TVs.\n\nAt Crypto.com Arena, Tunnel Suite members nosh on gourmet cuisine before a Kings game in March. SINNA NASSERI\n\nA full-time attendant will help you and 13 friends navigate the spread of gourmet cuisine and the fully stocked bar. At tip-off, you’ll be escorted to the roomier, prime seats in rows 3 to 9, a short way from the court (or ice). Membership also grants tickets to the Grammy Awards and events taking place during the 2028 Summer Olympics. With a setup this lavish, even Jack might feel a twinge of envy.\n\nClick here to see all our photos of the arenas’ private members clubs, lounges and more.\n\nSinna Nasseri",

Home to Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors, Chase Center pairs its basketball with Napa Valley sophistication. Chase Center’s Courtside Lounges have massive screens that overlook the court from three rows up. With a setup this lavish, even Jack might feel a twinge of envy."

        "title": "Dell XPS 14 (9440)",
        "text": "Dell's consumer flagship XPS laptops always flaunt an extra-fancy feature or two. (We're glad these days it's an LED touch-strip key row instead of a webcam aimed up your nose.) The new XPS 14 (model 9440, starting at $1,699; $2,099 as tested) shows off the flashy top row and seamless haptic touchpad that premiered in the Dell XPS 13 Plus, plus Intel's latest AI-enhanced silicon and Microsoft's dedicated key for AI-enhanced Windows Copilot. The Dell XPS 14 is a sleek and swift performer, but its only advantages over other slimline laptops are a barely larger 14.5-inch display and an optional discrete GPU for more content-creation performance. With that, the Asus Zenbook 14X OLED (UX3404) remains our Editors' Choice award holder for high-end ultraportable laptops, while Asus' own Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406) presents a similar experience for half the XPS 14's price.\n\nConfigurations and Design: Meteor Lake or Bust\n\nWhile Intel's Core Ultra 7 155H is the only processor choice you have at checkout, our review unit has the $400-extra 6GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 in place of the standard Intel Arc integrated graphics. Otherwise, this unit has base-model specs with 16GB of memory, a 512GB NVMe solid-state drive, Windows 11 Home, and an IPS screen with a 1,920-by-1,200-pixel resolution and variable 60Hz or 120Hz refresh rate (no touch control here). A tempting $300 OLED touch panel with a 3,200-by-2,000-pixel resolution is available as an option.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe XPS 14's memory- and storage-ceiling options are dense (64GB and 4TB respectively). Relatively speaking, so is the laptop's body, weighing 3.7 pounds (3.8 for OLED models), offsetting its trim size of 0.71 by 12.6 by 8.5 inches. By contrast, the HP Pavilion Plus 14 hits the scale at 3.04 pounds, and the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch qualifies as an ultraportable at 2.82 pounds.\n\nCrafted from CNC machined aluminum in either Graphite (black) or Platinum, the Dell exhibits almost no flex if you torque the screen corners or press the keyboard deck. What the company calls an InfinityEdge display has fashion-model-thin bezels, though I was dismayed that the webcam centered above the screen has neither a sliding privacy shutter nor a keyboard camera-kill command. The camera has IR face recognition, which coupled with a fingerprint-reader power button gives you two ways to skip typing passwords with Windows Hello.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nLike other Dell XPS notebooks, not to mention Apple Macbooks, the XPS 14 relies on USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports—two on the left edge and one on the right, the latter joined by an audio jack (shamefully missing from the Dell XPS 13) and a microSD card slot.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe laptop lacks USB Type-A and HDMI monitor ports, but you get one of each on a clever little dongle that, like the AC adapter, plugs into a USB-C port. You'll find no mobile broadband option here, but Intel Killer Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth come standard.\n\nUsing the Dell XPS 14: An Invisible Touchpad\n\nAs on the XPS 13 Plus, the XPS 14 keyboard is a voguish lattice, a rectangle sliced into flush-fitting squares instead of raised or separate keys. Even when its backlighting is turned off, the top row of LED icons is illuminated. Along with the Escape and Delete keys as well as volume and brightness controls, the row includes Home and End keys, though Page Up and Page Down are combinations of the Fn key and up and down cursor arrows. These arrow keys are sadly half-size keys stacked between full-size left and right arrows, in the awkward row instead of the proper inverted T that I always complain about in HP laptop reviews.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nDell's keyboard looks better than it feels: It's quiet and responsive but noticeably shallow and stiff. I make more than my usual amount of errors with these keys, and they would be uncomfortable to type on for hours. By contrast, the seamless glass touchpad was friendlier than I expected; it's placed so that muscle memory proves quite accurate for right-clicking (a tap at the bottom right), and it has a comfortable haptic click.\n\nThe webcam records in 1080p resolution and supports the recently added Windows Studio Effects for automatic framing, eye-contact adjustment, and background blurring. It's an above-average camera, capturing well-lit images even on a dark overcast day; we noted vivid color and no annoying noise or static.\n\nDell's entry-level IPS screen is impressively bright, with clean white backgrounds, though it doesn't tilt back quite as far as I'd like. The display's colors are rich and well-saturated, and it shows decently deep contrast and wide viewing angles. The screen's details are sharp with no pixelation around the edges of letters.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nPreinstalled on the system, the MyDell app works with the webcam to provide presence detection, locking and waking the PC as you walk away and return. This duo also protects your privacy by dimming the screen if you look away. MyDell also lets you fine-tune screen color tweaks such as gamma and temperature; choose optimized, quiet, or high-performance modes for cooling and fan noise; and launch a Killer networking dashboard to prioritize traffic for different apps and choose the strongest available Wi-Fi access point.\n\nOne more MyDell feature lets you toggle 3D audio effects and pick from equalizer profiles ranging from acoustic and jazz to metal and hip-hop. A set of 8-watt quad speakers pumps out loud but rather hollow audio. You'll hear a bit more bass than most laptops can muster, but drumbeats sound flat—at least it's easy to make out overlapping tracks.\n\nTesting the Dell XPS 14: Dedicated Graphics Don't Always Dazzle\n\nWhile the XPS 14 stands alone with a 14.5-inch display, you'll find plenty of 14-inch competitors on both sides of the 3-pound line that serves as our ultraportable cutoff. The Lenovo Slim 7i 14 Gen 9 and the Acer Swift Go 14 join the Dell in housing an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H CPU and a 1,920-by-1,200-pixel screen, though the Lenovo laptop has OLED instead of IPS tech. The abovementioned HP Pavilion Plus 14 and Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406) rely on AMD Ryzen instead of Intel processors.\n\nProductivity Tests\n\nWe run the same general productivity benchmarks across both mobile and desktop systems. Our first test is UL's PCMark 10, which simulates a variety of real-world productivity and office workflows to measure overall system performance and also includes a storage subtest for the primary drive.\n\nThree more benchmarks focus on the CPU, using all available cores and threads, to rate a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Maxon's Cinebench R23 uses that company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene, while Geekbench 5.5 Pro from Primate Labs simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning. We also use the open-source video transcoder HandBrake 1.4 to convert a 12-minute video clip from 4K to 1080p resolution (lower times are better).\n\nFinally, we run PugetBench for Photoshop by workstation maker Puget Systems, which uses the Creative Cloud version 22 of Adobe's famous image editor to rate a PC's performance for content creation and multimedia applications. It's an automated extension that executes a variety of general and GPU-accelerated Photoshop tasks ranging from opening, rotating, resizing, and saving an image to applying masks, gradient fills, and filters.\n\nAll five slimlines easily cleared the 4,000 points in PCMark 10, signaling excellent mainstream productivity for Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace. The XPS 14 performed well enough in our CPU tests and posted a competitive score in Photoshop; it's not meant for demanding workstation apps but is a fine choice as a daily driver.\n\nHowever, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch edged out the XPS 14 in several tests here, pointing toward competitive processing performance from AMD in this latest generation. Even more important, however, is that this Zenbook kept up with the XPS 14 for less than half the price at just $800 at the time of writing.\n\nGraphics Tests\n\nWe test each Windows PC's graphics with two DirectX 12 gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark, Night Raid (more modest, suitable for laptops with integrated graphics) and Time Spy (more demanding, suitable for gaming rigs with discrete GPUs).\n\nAdditionally, we run two tests from the cross-platform GPU benchmark GFXBench 5, which stresses both low-level routines like texturing and high-level, game-like image rendering. The 1440p Aztec Ruins and 1080p Car Chase tests are rendered offscreen to accommodate different display resolutions as well as exercise graphics and compute shaders using the OpenGL programming interface and hardware tessellation, respectively. The more frames per second (fps), the better.\n\nThe Dell's GeForce GPU predictably outran its rivals' integrated graphics in three of our four tests, though it laid down and died in Night Raid—a baffling lapse, since I tried the benchmark several times and configured Windows to use the RTX 4050 instead of Intel Arc Graphics. The others were hollow victories, with the XPS 14 underperforming by discrete-graphics standards, possibly because Dell's specs say the GPU is tuned to a tiny 30W.\n\nThis GPU wattage and performance weakens one of the Dell XPS 14's advantages as a nearly ultraportable laptop for creators. It should be enough to drive photo editing work, which might be this laptop's niche focus, but more intense visual work, like video editing and 3D content creation, would be better served by a higher-wattage chip.\n\nBattery and Display Tests\n\nWe test each laptop's battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie Tears of Steel) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test, with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off.\n\nTo gauge display performance, we also use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and its Windows software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation—what percentage of the sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show—and its 50% and peak brightness in nits (candelas per square meter).\n\nThe XPS almost tied the Zenbook for the win in our battery rundown, with more than enough stamina to get you through an all-day workday. It joined the other IPS system, the Acer, in trailing the OLED displays but showed suitable color coverage for anything short of pre-press or professional graphics, and it was the brightest screen in the testing quintet.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nVerdict: High Fashion, High Price\n\nDell doesn't make bad laptops, and the XPS 14 is an attractive, even elegant productivity partner with epic battery life. Unfortunately, it doesn't contend for Editors' Choice honors. Comparing base model with base model, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch crushes it on value. The Zenbook provides more-vivid color and contrast (with OLED versus IPS screen technology); it performs about as well, short of graphics tasks; it's about a pound lighter; and it costs $900 less. (Likewise, Asus fills the high-end ultraportable Editors' Choice slot with its still slightly cheaper Zenbook 14X OLED.) If you need an ultraportable laptop for photo editing specifically and little else creatively, then maybe the XPS 14 is a fit for you. Otherwise, Asus and even Apple have more affordable alternatives for that performance niche.",

The more frames per second (fps), the better.\n\nThe Dell's GeForce GPU predictably outran its rivals' integrated graphics in three of our four tests, though it laid down and died in Night Raid—a baffling lapse, since I tried the benchmark several times and configured Windows to use the RTX 4050 instead of Intel Arc Graphics. The others were hollow victories, with the XPS 14 underperforming by discrete-graphics standards, possibly because Dell's specs say the GPU is tuned to a tiny 30W.\n\nThis GPU wattage and performance weakens one of the Dell XPS 14's advantages as a nearly ultraportable laptop for creators. It should be enough to drive photo editing work, which might be this laptop's niche focus, but more intense visual work, like video editing and 3D content creation, would be better served by a higher-wattage chip.\n\nBattery and Display Tests\n\nWe test each laptop's battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie Tears of Steel) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test, with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off.\n\nTo gauge display performance, we also use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and its Windows software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation—what percentage of the sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show—and its 50% and peak brightness in nits (candelas per square meter).\n\nThe XPS almost tied the Zenbook for the win in our battery rundown, with more than enough stamina to get you through an all-day workday. It joined the other IPS system, the Acer, in trailing the OLED displays but showed suitable color coverage for anything short of pre-press or professional graphics, and it was the brightest screen in the testing quintet.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nVerdict: High Fashion, High Price\n\nDell doesn't make bad laptops, and the XPS 14 is an attractive, even elegant productivity partner with epic battery life. Unfortunately, it doesn't contend for Editors' Choice honors. Comparing base model with base model, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch crushes it on value. The Zenbook provides more-vivid color and contrast (with OLED versus IPS screen technology); it performs about as well, short of graphics tasks; it's about a pound lighter; and it costs $900 less. (Likewise, Asus fills the high-end ultraportable Editors' Choice slot with its still slightly cheaper Zenbook 14X OLED.) If you need an ultraportable laptop for photo editing specifically and little else creatively, then maybe the XPS 14 is a fit for you. Otherwise, Asus and even Apple have more affordable alternatives for that performance niche.",
        "summary": "Dell's consumer flagship XPS laptops always flaunt an extra-fancy feature or two. ( We're glad these days it's an LED touch-strip key row instead of a webcam aimed up your nose.) With that, the Asus Zenbook 14X OLED (UX3404) remains our Editors' Choice award holder for high-end ultraportable laptops, while Asus' own Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406) presents a similar experience for half the XPS 14's price. (Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nDell's keyboard looks better than it feels: It's quiet and responsive but noticeably shallow and stiff. The webcam records in 1080p resolution and supports the recently added Windows Studio Effects for automatic framing, eye-contact adjustment, and background blurring. It's an above-average camera, capturing well-lit images even on a dark overcast day; we noted vivid color and no annoying noise or static. The display's colors are rich and well-saturated, and it shows decently deep contrast and wide viewing angles. The abovementioned HP Pavilion Plus 14 and Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406) rely on AMD Ryzen instead of Intel processors. Three more benchmarks focus on the CPU, using all available cores and threads, to rate a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Finally, we run PugetBench for Photoshop by workstation maker Puget Systems, which uses the Creative Cloud version 22 of Adobe's famous image editor to rate a PC's performance for content creation and multimedia applications. The others were hollow victories, with the XPS 14 underperforming by discrete-graphics standards, possibly because Dell's specs say the GPU is tuned to a tiny 30W.\n\nThis GPU wattage and performance weakens one of the Dell XPS 14's advantages as a nearly ultraportable laptop for creators.

        "text": "Life can be ruff for the cosmopolitan canines of New Yorkie.\n\nLimbs caught in revolving doors and lethal rat poison on the sidewalk are just a couple of the quintessentially urban hazards that Big Apple pooches face, according to a city-based veterinarian with nearly 40 years on the job.\n\nRecently, Dr. Ann Hohenhaus was reading the overnight admissions list at the Upper East Side’s Schwarzmann Animal Medical Center when she came across the description of an incident she’d never seen before: A small pup was admitted with a fractured neck bone after a run-in with a revolving door.\n\n4 Recently, a Big Apple dog’s neck was fractured during a run-in with a revolving door. amcny.org\n\n“This poor dog was in a lot of pain. . . . every time he opened his mouth or turned his neck, he just hurt something terrible,” Hohenhaus recalled.\n\nFur-tunately, the little Fido’s fracture wasn’t near his spinal cord, which could have led to paralysis – and his treatment protocol only called for activity restriction, rest and pain meds, Hohenhaus wrote in a March 20 blog post.\n\nAlthough this was the first and only injury by revolving door she has seen, “there are a lot of revolving doors around New York, so I can’t imagine it’s the only one.”\n\nDogs’ toes getting caught in the grooves of escalator stairs “is nothing new,” on the other hand, and at least eight pooches have been admitted to AMC for escalator injuries since June 2022, she said.\n\n“The dog doesn’t know to pick its feet up to get off the escalator. . . . and their little toenails are just about the same size as those dividers on that escalator, so those nails just go right in [the grooves] and get caught,” Hohenhaus explained.\n\n4 Hohenhaus’s biggest piece of advice for NYC dog owners is to use “protective barriers,” like leashes and muzzles. Nataliia – stock.adobe.com\n\n4 Another dog’s middle toe had to be amputated after it was caught in the grooves of an escalator. amcny.org\n\nOne furry friend that recently befell this pawful fate came into AMC with a mangled middle toe, which ended up needing to be amputated, according to the vet.\n\n“If you have a little dog, you just need to pick it up on the escalator…If you have a big dog, say ‘come on’ and go, so that the dog isn’t just standing when it gets to the top,” Hohenhaus advised.\n\nDog owners should also be wary of elevator doors – which could gobble up their pooch’s leashes and cause strangulation – and open windows and rooftops, which dogs could run or fall from, she warned.\n\n4 Eating discarded chicken bones and cigarette butts off the sidewalk often causes urban dogs to feel ill, but rat poison can be lethal. Helayne Seidman\n\nWhile eating discarded chicken bones and cigarette butts off the sidewalk often causes urban canines to feel ill, rat poison poses the biggest threat to pooches.\n\n“Even Flaco [the Central Park owl] – rat poison was in his autopsy report!” she said.\n\nThe veteran veterinarian’s biggest piece of advice for NYC dog owners is to set up “protective barriers.”\n\n“Whether that barrier is a leash barrier, a basket muzzle, or screens on your window or a sliding door – barriers are really important for protecting your dogs from city hazards,” she said.",

I hope someone is taking care of his apples.\n\nWith Hitchens and Dennett dead, and Dawkins doddering on the edge of irrelevant crankiness, I guess that leaves young Mr Harris, the least of the quartet, holding the legacy of the Four Horsemen, and that propaganda concept can now fade away, unlamented.

        "text": "Let's talk about insurance. And just for the record: We're not selling any.\n\nBoth stocks and consumer spending have remained strong this year, but rising insurance costs threaten to put a dent in those trends. Not only is the cost of insurance going up, it's rising faster than it has in almost 50 years. The latest data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows car insurance increased by more than 22% compared to one year ago. It's the largest annual spike since 1976, when Apple Computer's headquarters was still in Steve Jobs' garage.\n\nSome of this is due to an increase in car crashes, injuries and fatalities, according to travel company AAA. But higher-priced cars that include higher-tech features are also more costly to repair. Not to mention that the body shop or mechanic doing the work is earning a higher wage.\n\nThe homeowners insurance industry is dealing with a similar re-rating of liabilities and costs. Ten states saw home insurance premiums increase more than 30% from a year ago, according to consumer services company Bankrate. Louisiana (+63%) might seem like an obvious victim, but landlocked states Nebraska (+61%) and Colorado (+49%) placed No. 2 and No. 3 on the list.\n\nSkyrocketing insurance premiums are hitting home for everyone. Even if you don't live in an area prone to severe weather, the carrier that issued your insurance policy likely has exposure there. It's not just local residents, in other words, bearing the costs of more frequent wildfires in California and hurricanes in Florida.\n\nSome companies have decided to discontinue coverage altogether, even in Minnesota. When our personal home and auto insurance was up for renewal this spring, our carrier notified us they were no longer issuing personal policies because of unprecedented losses related to properties in the Upper Midwest.\n\nAfter speaking to our general agent (an insurance broker who shops among multiple carriers), the best alternative was 43% more expensive for comparable coverage. Of the shrinking list of companies willing to insure our house, some required full inspections by licensed contractors on the homeowner's dime.\n\nThe rapidly changing insurance landscape stands in stark contrast to headline inflation. The latest consumer price index (CPI) released April 10 showed a 3.5% increase in the last 12 months. CPI is meant to reflect Americans' overall cost of living, but insurance costs are obviously bucking the trend.\n\nHere is what consumers can do to minimize their out-of-pocket costs:\n\nWork with a general agent. These are professionals whose job is to find you the best fit and best value among several insurance companies. It's a formal second opinion on your coverage. If they can't find you a better deal, you are no worse off for inquiring. They will also help determine if your existing coverage amounts and deductibles remain appropriate.\n\nAsk if your car insurance offers a mobile app that will track and report your driving behavior. Discounts often apply for safe driving. If you work from home and drive infrequently, that might also reduce your premiums.\n\nFrom an investment perspective, be mindful of the stocks and mutual funds you own tied to the financial sector. There's a big difference between a bank, a financial services firm and an insurance company, even though they lump together in the same category. None are inherently good or bad, but smart investors should always understand what they own.\n\nBen Marks is chief investment officer at Marks Group Wealth Management in Minnetonka. He can be reached at ben.marks@marksgroup.com. Brett Angel is a senior wealth adviser at the firm.",

        "text": "\"A lot of people are scared of AI, rightfully so.\"\n\nGood Kid, Mad AI\n\nA diss track featuring the apparent vocals of rapper Kendrick Lamar made its rounds on social media earlier this week, escalating the beef between him and Aubrey \"Drake\" Graham.\n\nNow a 23-year-old musician who goes by the moniker Sly the Rapper has come forward, alleging he's behind the viral track, which was titled simply \"Freestyle.\" And guess what? He says it was AI-generated.\n\nThat's impressive, because it fooled plenty of people into believing it was the real thing.\n\n\"I thought people were going to know that it was AI,\" Sly told Complex. \"Although it did sound real, it sounded like an old version of Kendrick Lamar.\"\n\n\"The style sounded kind of dated, so I just thought that would be a giveaway, but apparently it wasn't,\" he added.\n\nTo Pimp a ButterflAI\n\nThe use of AI in the music industry has sparked a heated debate over copyright, music piracy, and musicians' rights.\n\nThe news comes after a song that used AI-generated vocals to imitate Drake and Abel Makkonen \"the Weeknd\" Tesfaye went viral last year. Incensed by the song's success, record label Universal Music Group forced Spotify, Apple Music, and other music streamers to take the song down.\n\nThe latest AI-generated diss track adds plenty of confusion to an already messy beef between Lamar and Drake. On Friday, Drake officially released the studio version of \"Push Us,\" in which he took aim at Lamar.\n\nThe latest diss track also highlights just how easy it has become to generate believable-sounding vocals of famous musicians.\n\nSly told Complex that he used an AI software called Jammable — formerly known as Voicify AI — for his latest track, which allows users to create AI covers \"in seconds.\" A quick search on the company's website reveals several user-submitted AI models that can be used to imitate Lamar's vocals.\n\nEven YouTube has teased a new feature called \"Dream Features\" that's designed to allow users to create AI-generated songs using the licensed voices of famous artists including Demi Lovato, John Legend, and Troye Sivan.\n\nDespite initial skepticism over Sly's claims, the rapper provided Complex with proof in the form of timestamped videos and audio, including isolated audio tracks.\n\nThe musician, though, has some mixed feelings when it comes to the tech.\n\n\"A lot of people are scared of AI, rightfully so,\" he told Complex. \" I understand where the fear comes from, but AI isn't as advanced as people think that it is.\"\n\n\"There’s a lot that AI can't do,\" Sly added. \"It still can't mimic cadences. It can't mimic emotions.\"\n\nMore on AI in music: YouTube Launching AI Tool That Clones Singers' Voices",

        "text": "Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us?\n\nThe Oura Ring is a sleek and stylish wearable device that has gained popularity based on its advanced sleep-monitoring features. It provides users with detailed insights into their sleep patterns, including the duration of each sleep stage, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate. It also tracks other key health metrics, such as body temperature and activity levels.\n\nHowever, the question remains: Can the Oura Ring track fitness metrics such as step counting? It’s time to find out.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nDoes the Oura Ring track steps?\n\nThe simple answer is this: Yes, it does! The Oura Ring tracks steps. Similar to smartwatches like the Google Pixel Watch 2 and Apple Watch Series 9, the Oura Ring can track your steps just like any other fitness tracker. This feature allows you to gauge the distance you’ve traveled and the calories you’ve burned daily.\n\nHow to track steps with the Oura Ring\n\nIt’s important to note that activity tracking is not the primary focus of the Oura Ring. Therefore, it doesn’t measure steps in the traditional sense. Instead, it relies on its built-in 3D accelerometer to track your body movement throughout the day and estimate your step count.\n\nTo find your ste- tracking information via your smartphone on the Oura app for iPhone or Android, do the following:\n\nOpen the Oura app on your phone.\n\nTap on the Activity tab\n\nHere, you can see a snapshot of of how far you’ve walked and how many steps you’ve taken.\n\nChoose Steps to see a history of your step tracking.\n\nChoose Walking Equivalency to see the history of your distance walked.\n\nAccording to Oura, the walking equivalency metric does not indicate the exact distance you have traveled, but rather, it reflects the equivalent walking distance of all your daily activities. Also, engaging in higher-intensity activities like jogging increases your daily walking distance more than low-intensity activities, such as casual walking, even if the distance covered is the same.\n\nIf you’re looking for a more precise way to track your steps, consider buying a smartwatch. The best smartwatches available today offer more advanced tools for step tracking than the current Oura Ring. For instance, the Apple Watch Series 9 has GPS, an accelerometer, and a gyroscope to track arm movements and body position during exercise.\n\nThe Oura Ring’s long list of features makes it a popular choice for anyone who wants to track things like sleep, mental health, heart rate, and more.\n\nEditors' Recommendations",

        "title": "This artificially intelligent pin wants to free you from your phone",
        "text": "On a recent afternoon, I held a bagel in front of me and said: “Look and tell me if this is healthy.”\n\nA monotone voice responded that the bagel was unhealthy because it was high in carbohydrates, which could contribute to weight gain.\n\nI wasn’t talking to a tech bro obsessed with the ketogenic diet. This was the Ai Pin, a $700 tiny computer featuring a virtual assistant pulling data from OpenAI (the research firm behind the ChatGPT chatbot), Google, Microsoft and others to answer questions and perform tasks.\n\nShaped like a lapel pin that may be a throwback to “Star Trek,” it attaches to your clothing with magnets and is supposed to offload tasks you would normally do with a smartphone, like taking notes, searching the web and shooting photos. Instead of a screen, the pin shines a green laser on your hand to show text. The device includes a camera, speaker and cellular connection.\n\nThe novel design of the Ai Pin, which was made by the startup Humane, generated buzz when it was unveiled late last year. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, and companies including Microsoft and Salesforce have placed a bold bet — to the tune of $240 million in funding for Humane — that artificially intelligent hardware like the Ai Pin will become the next big thing after the smartphone. (The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft last year for using copyrighted news articles without permission to train chatbots.)\n\nHumane said its goal with the Ai Pin was to offer technology that would help people avoid screens and maintain eye contact.\n\nI liked the chic aesthetic and concept of the pin. It was occasionally helpful, like when it suggested items to pack for my recent trip to Hawaii. But as I wore it for two weeks, it presented glaring flaws. Often, its responses were off-putting, like with the bagel, or wrong, like when it said the square root of 49 was 49. Also, the Times’ photo shoot of the Ai Pin ended prematurely when the device overheated and shut down.\n\nI wouldn’t pay $700 for this pin — let alone the $24-a-month subscription required to use its data services, including its T-Mobile cellular plan. But consider my curiosity piqued.\n\nImran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, Humane’s husband-and-wife founders, who worked at Apple, said updates issued through its servers would address many of the glitches I had encountered, including heat issues and shoddy math.\n\n“It’s a journey, and we are just at the start,” Bongiorno said. “The first version is never the entirety of the vision.”\n\nHere’s how my experience wearing the Ai Pin went.\n\nGetting started\n\nSince the Ai Pin lacks a screen, users set up their accounts and other settings on Humane’s website. To unlock the device with a passcode, hold out your hand to project a green laser onto your palm. Pulling your hand outward increases the number while pulling it inward decreases it, and you select each digit by pinching two fingers on the same hand.\n\nThe laser can be used to tweak other settings, like connecting to a Wi-Fi network, and it can show a text transcription of the virtual assistant’s answers. Humane said the laser was intended to be used for no longer than nine minutes, but for me, it lasted about three before the Ai Pin complained it was too hot and shut down.\n\nA virtual assistant\n\nBeyond unlocking the pin with the laser, you’ll control the Ai Pin mostly with finger taps and your voice. The advantage of pinning a virtual assistant to my shirt became clear when I was moving around and thinking about the many things I had to do.\n\nWith one finger held down on the Ai Pin, I could summon the assistant and ask it to add tasks to my to-do list. This feature shined when I was packing for my vacation to Hawaii and adding items to my packing list, including T-shirts and swim trunks. When I asked the pin to suggest other items to pack for my trip there, it recommended a hat, sunscreen and other relevant items. Very cool.\n\nHowever, the Ai Pin was less helpful in some other situations. When I was in Hawaii last week, I struggled to remember the name of a food truck near my hotel serving loco moco, so I asked the assistant to look it up for me. It said no such food truck could be found, leading me to search on my phone instead.\n\nA language interpreter\n\nAn important feature on the Ai Pin is the ability to translate a conversation into another language in real time. With one finger held down on the pin, I could set a language to translate to, such as Mandarin. When I held two fingers down on the pin and spoke a phrase in English, the Ai Pin said it in Mandarin, and vice versa.\n\nI tested this with several other languages, including Spanish, French and Indonesian. I confirmed that the interpreter was usually correct, though with converting English into Mandarin, it incorrectly translated “good morning” into “da jia hao,” which means “hello, everyone.”\n\nWould you look at that?\n\nHumane is including a feature called Vision on the Ai Pin, which is labeled “beta” to signal that it is unfinished. The device uses its camera and AI to analyze your surroundings and give information about what you are looking at. This is what led to my quirky experience with a bagel, which only got weirder when I asked more questions.\n\nI asked the pin how to make the bagel more delicious, and it proceeded to explain how to make bagels from scratch. Eventually, I asked the pin to come up with suggestions for sandwiches that could be made with the bagel. It generated a long list of ideas, including chickpea salad sandwiches, sloppy Joes and cucumber sandwiches with green chutney.\n\nOn vacation, I visited a botanical garden and asked the pin to identify a flower. “The flower is yellow with red stripes on the inside,” the pin said. This was correct, but it didn’t answer my question.\n\n“It’s a Solandra maxima,” my wife said. She had taken a photo of the flower with her phone and uploaded it into a Google Images search. I felt sheepish.\n\nHumane said it was working constantly to improve the Vision feature.\n\nThe phone stuff\n\nSimilar to a smartphone, the Ai Pin has its own phone number and cellular data connection to place phone calls and play music, and its camera can be used to shoot photos and videos.\n\nHere is where the Ai Pin especially underdelivered. For something designed to make you spend less time on your phone, it isn’t better than a smartphone at any of those tasks. Photos and videos taken with the camera look poorly lit and blurry. To place a phone call, you can ask the assistant to call someone in your address book, but to dial a new number, you dictate the digits. For music, the device currently works only with Tidal, an unpopular music streaming service.\n\nBongiorno said the Ai Pin let her take more candid photos without a screen getting in the way. But to me, this was a disadvantage. Without a viewfinder, photos looked poorly framed.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhile the Ai Pin was occasionally useful and impressive, it was wrong, unhelpful or inefficient enough times to drive me back to my phone.\n\nGary Marcus, an AI entrepreneur, said the mistakes the Ai Pin made, like with the bagel, were the result of so-called hallucinations, the tendency for AI to guess and make things up when it can’t find the right answer. That’s a problem that remains unsolved in many AI technologies including ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.\n\nBongiorno acknowledged that hallucinations were happening with Gemini, the technology behind the Ai Pin’s Vision feature. She added that the technology would improve rapidly with user feedback and that the company had already finessed the pin’s reaction to bagels.\n\nMarcus said no company yet had AI technology that was sophisticated enough to make a virtual assistant answer questions reliably.\n\n“It’s almost like a broken watch being right twice a day,” he said. “It’s right some of the time, but you don’t know which part of the time, and that greatly diminishes its value.”\n\nYet there is a kernel of an idea worth preserving. I liked having an assistant on my shirt when it was actually helpful. I’ll pin my hopes on future iterations of the product — perhaps a cheaper one that lacks a camera and a laser.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\nGet more business news by signing up for our Economy Now newsletter.",

But those two phones launched in October 2023, so we're already looking ahead to later in the year when we may see the Pixel 9 series.\n\nRumors are still quite patchy, but there are some key bits of information we've been able to glean about the upcoming range.\n\nWe'll be updating this story over the next several months as the Pixel 9 launch gets closer, so keep checking back.\n\nRead more: Why I Need Apple to Make a Foldable iPhone\n\nWatch this: What Google Gemini AI on the iPhone Could Look Like 08:16\n\nFall 2024 launch\n\nGoogle usually releases its new Pixel devices in October, as was the case with the Pixel 8 series and Pixel 7 series. There are currently no rumors to suggest Google is looking to radically alter its product release timeline, so it seems likely we'll be seeing the Pixel 9 series later in the year.\n\nThe Pixel 8 series' 2023 launch happened in the month of October. We'd expect a similar date for the Pixel 9. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nIn the meantime, Google I/O takes place in May, and it's possible we'll see a teaser for the upcoming range, and possibly an announcement of the more affordable Pixel 8A.\n\nThree Pixel 9 models\n\nA rumor that's persisted since Android Authority published it back in late 2022 is that there'll be three models of the Pixel 9 phone, rather than the usual two. It's expected that we'll still see a base Pixel 9, but there may now be two versions of the flagship Pro range: a large model and a smaller one.\n\nRead more: Top Phones to Expect in 2024\n\nThe smaller version will reportedly be similar in size to the base model but will include the higher-performance cameras typically seen only with the larger size. The 9 Pro XL (as it's rumored to be named) would feature the same higher-end specs but with a larger display.\n\nThis more closely mirrors Apple's strategy, which typically includes the base iPhone models, along with two Pro phones in different sizes with beefed-up cameras.\n\niPhone-like design\n\nSpeaking of the iPhone, it's possible the Pixel 9 range will get design changes that echo some of the iPhone 15's aesthetics. Renders apparently acquired by notable tipster OnLeaks and published by MySmartPrice show a Pixel 9 with flat, metal sides and a flat back panel that look similar to those seen on the most recent iPhones.\n\nThe other big physical change shown in the leaks is to the camera bar on the back. Previously, this was one solid bar that stretched the whole width of the phone, connecting to the edges on both sides. The renders suggest the camera bar will instead become an oval island that stands alone in the middle.\n\nA render purportedly of the Pixel 9. MySmartPrice/@OnLeaks\n\nWhile the rumors haven't been specific about what size displays we may see, most signs suggest the base Pixel 9 will remain around 6.1 inches, with the 9 Pro coming in at a similar size. The 9 Pro XL would be larger, measuring around 6.8 inches, in line with the sizing of the current Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nSimilar cameras\n\nFull camera specs have yet to leak, so there's little for photographers like me to get excited about just yet. However the rumors regarding a third size for the Pixel 9 family suggest that this will allow Google to bring the same triple-camera setup -- including telephoto zoom -- to the smaller Pixel 9 Pro. Currently, that's available only on the larger Pixel 8 Pro handset.\n\nThat's good news for those of you who prefer a smaller phone but still want the best features. Though whether Google takes a page from Apple's book by adding exclusive features to its largest phone remains to be seen. (The iPhone 15 Pro Max, for example, has a 5x optical zoom option that isn't available on the smaller iPhone 15 Pro.)\n\nThe Pixel 8 and 8 Pro have decent, but not top-end, performance. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nNew Tensor processor\n\nIt's pretty much a given that Google will unveil the latest generation of its homegrown processor, likely to be called the Tensor G4. Google's Tensor processors aren't top of the class in terms of raw power, but the company boasts they're particularly tuned for on-device AI. We expect that'll once again be the case for Google's next Tensor chip.\n\nAndroid 15 at launch\n\nGoogle always uses the Pixel line to show off the latest that Android has to offer, so it's safe to assume the Pixel 9 series will launch with the latest Android 15 on board. Android 15 is set to be officially unveiled at Google I/O in May, but the early developer previews show new settings for improved privacy and camera control.\n\nOne major new feature may be the addition of satellite messaging, according to Android Authority, helping the Pixel line compete with Apple's Emergency SOS features that also use satellite messaging.\n\nThe Pixel 8 line launched with Android 14 on board. The Pixel 9 will almost certainly launch with Android 15. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nBeyond that, it's safe to assume there'll be increased focus on generative AI features. We also hope to see Google continue to offer at least seven years of software support as it did with the Pixel 8. If it does, the Pixel 9 series will still be safe to use in 2031.\n\nHigher prices\n\nThere aren't any rumors about potential prices for the Pixel 9 series yet, but leaks via WinFuture suggest the upcoming Pixel 8A will be more expensive than its predecessor, at least in Europe. The Pixel 7A launched at 509 Euros (around $542), but the Pixel 8A could cost 569 Euros ($606), according to the report -- a significant year-on-year increase. A price increase for the Pixel 8A doesn't necessarily mean a more expensive Pixel 9 range, but it does suggest Google isn't shy about upping its prices.",

        "text": "In this article MS\n\nNOVO.B-DK\n\nLLY Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA food delivery messenger carries a take out bag outside aSweetgreen in Manhattan on September 14, 2023. Jeenah Moon | The Washington Post | Getty Images\n\nA highly popular group of weight loss and diabetes drugs is decreasing some consumers' appetites — and also how much they spend on food. Most people taking those medications, called GLP-1s, say they are spending less on eating out at restaurants and ordering takeout, according to a Morgan Stanley survey released on Tuesday. A smaller share of those surveyed say they are tightening their purse strings in the grocery store. The findings add to the mounting concerns that soaring demand for GLP-1s could take a bite out of the bottom lines of some of the biggest restaurant companies and makers of packaged snacks like Doritos, Oreos and Hershey's Kisses. GLP-1s include Novo Nordisk 's blockbuster weight loss injection Wegovy and diabetes counterpart Ozempic, along with Eli Lilly 's popular weight loss treatment Zepbound and diabetes injection Mounjaro. The rising demand for these four drugs isn't expected to ease anytime soon. In the new survey, Morgan Stanley analysts said they expect the market for GLP-1s to be worth $105 billion by 2030. They also estimate that 31.5 million people, or around 9% of the U.S. population, will take GLP-1s by 2035. \"There is growing evidence that the drugs have a meaningful impact on consumer behavior and spending on groceries and restaurants,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said in the survey. \"All of these dynamics suggest GLP-1 drugs' impact across consumer sectors is set to increase as drug uptake grows and the drugs reshape behavior among a demographic group that represents a disproportionate share of calorie consumption.\"\n\nBoxes of Wegovy made by Novo Nordisk are seen at a pharmacy in London, Britain March 8, 2024. Hollie Adams | Reuters\n\nMorgan Stanley conducted the survey of 300 consumers who are currently taking GLP-1 drugs in February. Those people are \"early in their weight loss journey,\" but are making substantial changes to their diets and spending, according to the firm. When asked to gauge how their monthly spending on eating out at restaurants has changed since starting a GLP-1, 63% of the consumers said they are spending less, 28% said they are spending about the same amount, and 9% said they are spending more. Meanwhile, 61% said they are spending less on deliveries or takeout from restaurants, 31% said they are spending around the same amount and 8% said they are spending more. Fewer participants said they lowered their grocery spending since they started a GLP-1: 31% said they are spending less, 46% said they are spending around the same amount and 23% said they are spending more. The survey also found that people tended to stick with the same restaurant but changed the kinds of meals they ordered. When asked whether they finish less of the food they order in one sitting when dining out, 42% of participants said \"always\" or \"most of the time,\" and 44% said \"occasionally.\" Forty-one percent said they are \"always\" or \"most of the time\" ordering smaller portions of food overall, while 43% said they are only sometimes doing that. Consumers in the survey reported reduced food consumption across the board, but the difference is most notable on snacks, confections, carbonated and sugary drinks and alcohol, according to the Morgan Stanley survery. Roughly half of people reported cutting consumption of regular sodas, alcohol and salty snacks by 50% or more since starting on weight loss drugs. Twenty-two percent reported stopping alcohol consumption entirely.",

        "text": "Apple says it sees its Vision Pro headset as an essential addition to every business and is pushing for more enterprises to adopt the firm’s advanced wearable tech.\n\nWhile spatial computing certainly has a role in business, allowing firms to create experiences that were, until now, impossible, or at least, unrealistic, many firms remain unconvinced of the benefits, which is a view that Apple wants to change.\n\nThe company says enterprise developers are making headway in several categories, from productivity and product design to immersive training and guided work. By using Vision Pro, companies can reinvent workspace environments while enhancing everyday productivity.\n\nEnhancing everyday productivity\n\nThe tech behemoth is keen to stress the many uses its wearable tech can be put to, from allowing users to easily access and manipulate their data using popular productivity apps like Microsoft 365 and SAP Analytics Cloud, to streamlining business decision-making with real-time access to data dashboards, 3D maps, and graphics.\n\n“There’s tremendous opportunity for businesses to reimagine what’s possible using Apple Vision Pro at work,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations and Enterprise Marketing.\n\n“We’re thrilled to see the innovative ways organizations are already using Apple Vision Pro, from planning fire response operations to iterating on the most intricate details of an engine design - and this is just the beginning. Combined with enterprise-grade capabilities like mobile device management built into visionOS, we believe spatial computing has the potential to revolutionize industries around the world.”\n\nThrough data visualization on the Vision Pro, businesses can also explore advanced design and collaboration opportunities and aid in training procedures. Apple says guided work, which often requires a comprehensive understanding of a person’s surroundings, is another area where the Vision Pro comes in handy. The wearable technology could also provide invaluable assistance in emergency response, maintenance and repairs, utilities management, or even construction projects.\n\nAre you a pro?

This is the biggest challenge Apple must overcome if it is to secure broader adoption of its headset.",

In 2023, a group of major technology players dubbed the Magnificent Seven — Tesla , Amazon , Meta Platforms , Apple , Microsoft , Alphabet and Nvidia — contributed to a large chunk of the market's rally.\n\nThose tail winds continued into 2024, but even the winners eventually reach their limit. Indeed, some of this year's highest fliers came down to earth on Friday, with Big Tech names dragging down the Nasdaq Composite by more than 2%.\n\n\"You have to do your work,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \"You want to do the research, you want to know what you're buying, you want to know the risks involved. In AI right now, there are a lot of unknowns.\"\n\nAI is poised to be a central theme as the technology transitions from early-stage winners to second-stage adopters. Portfolio and wealth managers say investors may want to undertake certain strategies if they're looking for long-term plays in the space.\n\nWhat to look for\n\nThere's no secret formula to investing and picking artificial intelligence stocks, but investors can keep an eye on certain metrics and trends when weeding out the winners from the duds.\n\nWhen investing in any new industry, Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, recommends that investors keep an eye on companies' cash burn and how they are spending their money. Be attentive to the fine details, including how a company works through a backlog and how much money it devotes toward infrastructure.\n\nWhen it comes to chip stocks, Schleif also recommends taking a look at government grants. The industry won big in 2022 when President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law. The measure allocated funds toward building out semiconductor production on U.S. soil.\n\nSamsung Electronics is in line to receive funding from CHIPS for making semiconductors in Texas, while Intel has been awarded up to $8.5 billion from the measure.\n\n\"Focus on the underlying fundamentals, and are they moving in the right direction, [rather] than just last quarter's earnings,\" Schleif advised.\n\nInvestors should also avoid blindly chasing the hot winners that have benefited from AI enthusiasm. For Laffer Tengler Investments CEO and CIO Nancy Tengler, that means looking at some of the old-economy stocks embracing the new digital wave. She likes Microsoft and IBM , a pair of tech industry veterans.\n\nWhen building any portfolio, financial advisors and portfolio managers stress the importance of diversification — and the same applies to AI.\n\nAn exchange-traded fund might be a good way to get that diversified exposure to a basket of stocks that could benefit from the AI theme, rather than sticking with one or two promising names.\n\nConsider diversifying through ETFs\n\nSelecting ETFs that incorporate dozens of names can be a lower-risk way to diversify, said Marguerita Cheng, a certified financial planner and CEO of Blue Ocean Global Wealth in Gaithersburg, Maryland.\n\nShe highlighted the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) , the First Trust Nasdaq AI and Robotics ETF (ROBT) and the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ).\n\n\"That's one way to get some exposure without putting the proverbial all the eggs in that one basket,\" said BMO's Schleif. \"You want to be able to focus on a few different avenues such that you can withstand the volatility.\"",

        "text": "A high school soccer game at a public field in East Harlem was canceled after a group of migrants refused to leave the pitch so the kids could play.\n\n“I directly asked them to leave and some of them kind of took it into consideration, but then four or five of them said, ‘You know what, f–k it, we don’t have to leave, we can do whatever we want,'” said Erik Johansson, the coach of the Manhattan Kickers 17-year-old boys travel team.\n\nAbout 40 boys from both teams showed up on Sunday, April 14 at Thomas Jefferson Park for the 5 p.m. match.\n\nThe Kickers were set to face off against FA Euro New York.\n\n4 A soccer match between two club teams was canceled last week when a group of supposed migrants refused to leave the field. Helayne Seidman\n\n4 Travel teams in the city struggle to find available field space, according to parents and coaches. Helayne Seidman\n\nBut a group of about 30 men who appeared to be African migrants and spoke little English, wouldn’t leave — even when the cops showed up.\n\nTo resolve the conflict, the cops asked to see a copy of the club team’s city permit.\n\n“When you show up with two teams in uniform, a ref and two coaches, usually nobody is asking to see your permit,” said Johansson.\n\nBy the time Johansson’s assistant was able to forward a copy of the Kickers’ permit, the game had been delayed 30 minutes and the teams didn’t feel safe.\n\n“Even when the game is over, you don’t know if they’re waiting for you, so even if the cops kicked them out, it may not be over. So we just all agreed, this is too dangerous,” Johansson said.\n\n4 Weekends at Thomas Jefferson Park are busy with permitted teams and other groups competing for field time. Helayne Seidman\n\nIn his home country of Sweden — which saw a massive influx of migrants in recent years — the clashes on the pitch were all too common.\n\n“I have seen this before, I know how bad it can get,” he said.\n\nParents told him they were rattled by the incident, and don’t want to play at the field anymore. Johansson said they don’t plan to return.\n\n4 Randall’s Island, which sits on the other side of the Harlem River opposite Thomas Jefferson Park, was converted into shelter space for 2,000 migrants last year at the expense of the popular youth soccer fields. Helayne Seidman\n\nAt other fields, like in East River Park, they don’t have these issues — but field space in the city is limited and they take what they can get.\n\n“It’s so frustrating that the guys who refused to follow the rules won,” Maud Maron, a SoHo mom whose son plays on the team, told The Post.\n\n“That’s the message the kids got.”\n\nShe said it is a sign of the Big Apple becoming “lawless.”\n\nThe East Harlem field is packed with teams competing with adults for weekend time on the turf, parkgoers said. Randall’s Island, which sits on the other side of the Harlem River, was converted into shelter space for 2,000 migrants last year at the expense of the popular youth soccer fields.",

They insist that they're presenting research for generating virtual interactive characters and not for impersonating anyone. As such, there's no product or API planned.\n\n\"Our research focuses on generating visual affective skills for virtual AI avatars, aiming for positive applications,\" the Redmond boffins state. \"It is not intended to create content that is used to mislead or deceive.\n\n\"However, like other related content generation techniques, it could still potentially be misused for impersonating humans. We are opposed to any behavior to create misleading or harmful contents of real persons, and are interested in applying our technique for advancing forgery detection.\"\n\nKevin Surace, Chair of Token, a biometric authentication biz, and frequent speaker on generative AI, told The Register in an email that while there have been prior technology demonstrations of faces animated from a still frame and cloned voice file, Microsoft's demonstration reflects the state of the art.\n\n\"The implications for personalizing emails and other business mass communication is fabulous,\" he opined. \"Even animating older pictures as well. To some extent this is just fun and to another it has solid business applications we will all use in the coming months and years.\"\n\nThe \"fun\" of deepfakes was 96 percent nonconsensual porn, when assessed [PDF] in 2019 by cybersecurity firm Deeptrace.\n\nNonetheless, Microsoft's researchers suggest that being able to create realistic looking people and put words in their mouths has positive uses.\n\n\"Such technology holds the promise of enriching digital communication, increasing accessibility for those with communicative impairments, transforming education, methods with interactive AI tutoring, and providing therapeutic support and social interaction in healthcare,\" they propose in a research paper that does not contain the words \"porn\" or \"misinformation.\"\n\nWhile it's arguable AI generated video is not quite the same as a deepfake, the latter defined by digital manipulation as opposed to a generative method, the distinction becomes immaterial when a convincing fake can be conjured without cut-and-paste grafting.\n\nAsked what he makes of the fact that Microsoft is not releasing this technology to the public for fear of misuse, Surace expressed doubt about the viability of restrictions.\n\n\"Microsoft and others have held back for now until they work out the privacy and usage issues,\" he said. \"How will anyone regulate who uses this for the right reasons?\"\n\nSurace added that there are already open source models that are similarly sophisticated, pointing to EMO. \"One can pull the source code from GitHub and build a service around it that arguably would rival Microsoft's output,\" he observed. \"Because of the open source nature of the space, regulating it will be impossible in any case.\"\n\nThat said, countries around the world are trying to regulate AI-fabricated people. Canada, China, and the UK, among other nations, all have regulations that can be applied to deepfakes, some of which fulfill broader political goals. Britain just this week made it illegal to create a sexually explicit deepfake image without consent. The sharing of such images was already disallowed under the UK's Online Safety Act of 2023.\n\nIn January, a bipartisan group of US lawmakers introduced the Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits Act of 2024 (DEFIANCE Act), a bill that creates a way for victims of non-consensual deepfake images to file a civil claim in court.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, April 16, the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law held a hearing titled \"Oversight of AI: Election Deepfakes.\"\n\nIn prepared remarks, Rijul Gupta, CEO of DeepMedia, a deepfake detection biz, said:\n\n[T]he most alarming aspect of deepfakes is their ability to provide bad actors with plausible deniability, allowing them to dismiss genuine content as fake. This erosion of public trust strikes at the very core of our social fabric and the foundations of our democracy. The human brain, wired to believe what it sees and hears, is particularly vulnerable to the deception of deepfakes. As these technologies become increasingly sophisticated, they threaten to undermine the shared sense of reality that underpins our society, creating a climate of uncertainty and skepticism where citizens are left questioning the veracity of every piece of information they encounter.\n\nBut think of the marketing applications. ®",

To keep data centers from overheating, companies use water to cool down the hardware.\n\nAccording to China Water Risk, China could triple the number of data centers by 2030, reaching roughly 11 million data center racks that house servers and other equipment.\n\nAnd it's not just China. The AI boom is already leading to an astronomical amount of water being used elsewhere, including in the US. Last year, researchers found that just in training GPT-3 alone, OpenAI partner Microsoft consumed a whopping 185,000 gallons of water, which is enough to cool an entire nuclear reactor. Google also admitted in its 2023 Environmental Report that it had used up an astronomical 5.6 billion gallons of water in 2022.\n\nAI chatbots are vastly more energy-intensive than conventional methods of finding information online, relying on specialized chips that consume huge amounts of electricity.\n\nPer China Water Risk's report, if 100 million users were to chat with OpenAI's ChatGPT, it would consume the equivalent of 20 Olympic swimming pools. Doing the same via simple Google searches would only \"consume one swimming pool.\"\n\nAll that usage could have devastating effects on parts of the world where water resources are already extremely scarce. Last month, The Atlantic reported that Microsoft was trying to cover up the water usage of its data center in the Arizona desert.\n\nKeep Cool and Carry On\n\nAnd the AI hype cycle isn't quite over yet. Experts are worried about the further rise of energy and water usage.\n\nArm Holdings Plc CEO Rene Haas told Bloomberg this week that he expects the world's data centers to use more electricity than India, the world's most populous nation, by the end of the decade.\n\n\"We are still incredibly in the early days in terms of the capabilities,\" he said, ringing the alarm bells over AI eclipsing our global energy demands.\n\nTo Haas, one meaningful step forward is to find new ways to train and power these AI models with more energy-efficient chips.\n\n\"There needs to be broad breakthroughs,\" he told Bloomberg. \"Any piece of efficiency matters.\"\n\nMore on AI and water: Microsoft Is Draining Arizona's Water for its AI",

        "text": "A GitHub flaw, or possibly a design decision, is being abused by threat actors to distribute malware using URLs associated with a Microsoft repository, making the files appear trustworthy.\n\nWhile most of the malware activity has been based around the Microsoft GitHub URLs, this \"flaw\" could be abused with any public repository on GitHub, allowing threat actors to create very convincing lures.\n\nAbusing GitHub's file upload feature\n\nYesterday, McAfee released a report on a new LUA malware loader distributed through what appeared to be a legitimate Microsoft GitHub repository for the \"C++ Library Manager for Windows, Linux, and MacOS,\" known as vcpkg.\n\nThe URLs for the malware installers, shown below, clearly indicate that they belong to the Microsoft repo, but we could not find any reference to the files in the project's source code.\n\nhttps://github[.]com/microsoft/vcpkg/files/14125503/Cheat.Lab.2.7.2.zip https://github[.]com/microsoft/STL/files/14432565/Cheater.Pro.1.6.0.zip\n\nFinding it strange that a Microsoft repo would be distributing malware since February, BleepingComputer looked into it and found that the files are not part of vcpkg but were uploaded as part of a comment left on a commit or issue in the project.\n\nWhen leaving a comment, a GitHub user can attach a file, which will be uploaded to GitHub's CDN and associated with the related project using a unique URL in this format: 'https://www.github.com/{project_user}/{repo_name}/files/{file_id}/{file_name}.'\n\nInstead of generating the URL after a comment is posted, GitHub automatically generates the download link after you add the file to an unsaved comment, as shown below. This allows threat actors to attach their malware to any repository without them knowing.\n\nDownload link auto-generated when adding a file to a comment\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\n\nEven if you decide not to post the comment or delete it after it is posted, the files are not deleted from GitHub's CDN, and the download URLs continue to work forever.\n\nAs the file's URL contains the name of the repository the comment was created in, and as almost every software company uses GitHub, this flaw can allow threat actors to develop extraordinarily crafty and trustworthy lures.\n\nFor example, a threat actor could upload a malware executable in NVIDIA's driver installer repo that pretends to be a new driver fixing issues in a popular game. Or a threat actor could upload a file in a comment to the Google Chromium source code and pretend it's a new test version of the web browser.\n\nThese URLs would also appear to belong to the company's repositories, making them far more trustworthy.\n\nUnfortunately, even if a company learns their repos are abused to distribute malware, BleepingComputer could not find any settings that allow you to manage files attached to your projects.\n\nFurthermore, you can only protect a GitHub account from being abused in this way and tarnishing your reputation by disabling comments. According to this GitHub support document, you can only temporarily disable comments for a maximum of six months at a time.\n\nHowever, restricting comments can significantly impact a project's development as it will not allow users to report bugs or suggestions.\n\nSergei Frankoff, of automated malware analysis service UNPACME, did a livestream on Twitch about this bug just last month, saying that threat actors were actively abusing it.\n\nWeeks later... GitHub bug still dropping malware pic.twitter.com/s165zOAsoI — herrcore (@herrcore) March 27, 2024\n\nAs part of our research into this bug, BleepingComputer could only find one other repo, httprouter, abused to distribute malware in this way, and it was the same 'Cheater.Pro.1.6.0.zip' as seen in Microsoft's URLs.\n\nHowever, Frankoff told BleepingComputer that they discovered a similar campaign in March that utilizes the same LUA loader malware, which is called SmartLoader, disguised as the Aimmy cheat software.\n\nFrankoff told BleepingComputer that SmartLoader is commonly installed alongside other payloads, such as the RedLine information-stealing malware.\n\nBleepingComputer contacted both GitHub and Microsoft on Thursday about this abuse but did not receive a response.\n\nAt the time of this publication, the information-stealing malware is still being distributed through links associated with Microsoft' GitHub repository.",

        "text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works\n\nEarlier this month, we covered an interesting trick to bypass the system requirements on Windows 11 PCs. It involves choosing the \"IoT Enterprise LTSC\" option when selecting the OS during the setup.\n\nHowever, as it turns out, it looks like this bypass trick works for non-LTSC (Long Term Servicing Channel) as well, as discovered by the same Twitter (now X) user and tech enthusiast, Bob Pony. However, it seems to work only on the latest Windows 11 version, 24H2.\n\nJust found out that it also applies for the regular Windows 11 IoT Enterprise edition (non-LTSC) when picked in the Windows Setup.\n\n\n\nIt's pretty clear that IoT Enterprise is the SUPERIOR edition of Windows 11, no need to bypass any system requirements B.S. with any workarounds! 🎉 https://t.co/ErkbaNglZ8 pic.twitter.com/SzKaNRwbWO — Bob Pony (@TheBobPony) April 20, 2024\n\nAs many of you already know, the Windows 11 system requirements have always been a bone of contention among enthusiasts and users alike as Microsoft deemed relatively new processors (at that time), like Intel's 7th gen (Kaby Lake) and AMD's first-gen Ryzen (1000 series), as incompatible. These were fairly capable CPUs and would have easily been able to run Windows 11.\n\nHowever, these chips, and anything older, did not possess certain security features that the Redmond giant felt were crucial in order to run its latest OS. From time to time, the company updates the CPU list as new products are released. The latest update was made in March this year.\n\nAside from CPUs, TPM version 2.0 was also made mandatory. Again, Microsoft reasoned that such were the strict security characteristics Windows 11 brought. The recently announced AI PCs now include Microsoft Pluton to improve on that, though this is not a mandatory requirement.\n\nRegardless, people have continued to use bypasses so as to be able to install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware. Interestingly, Microsoft, too, made a registry bypass official, though with a fair amount of warning.\n\nBack in October 2023, we reported about a single command trick that allowed users to bypass the Windows 11 system requirements check during the setup process. While we only came across it in October, this trick had been doing the rounds since back in 2022.",

Notice how the letters “K” “I” and “M” are all in capital letters.\n\nHere’s the lyrics:\n\nThe lyrics appear to be about a mean girl at school, but fans honed in on several lines in particular.\n\n“I don’t think you’ve changed much/ And so I changed your name, and any real defining clues,” Swift sings on the track. “And one day, your kid comes home singin’/ A song that only us two is gonna know is about you.”\n\nFans pointed out Kardashian’s oldest daughter North West has posted TikToks about Swift.\n\nSwifties also looked at the lyrics to the 27th song, “Cassandra,” and found possible references to the billionaire owner of Skims, who once referred to Swift with the snake emoji — which later became a defining symbol of the singer’s “Reputation” era.\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA – AUGUST 30: (L-R) Recording artist Taylor Swift, TV personalities Kim Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian during the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards at Microsoft Theater on August 30, 2015 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Jeff Kravitz/MTV1415/FilmMagic)\n\n“So they killed Cassandra first ‘cause she feared the worst/ And tried to tell the town,” Swift sings on “Cassandra.” “So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say/ Do you believe me now?”\n\nAnother part of the song references “the call,” which could be a nod to the phone call Kardashian recorded between her then-husband Kanye West and Swift in 2016.\n\n“I was in my new house placing daydreams/ Patching up the crack along the wall,” Swift sings on “Cassandra.” “I pass it and lose track of what I’m saying/ ‘Cause that’s where I was when I got the call.”\n\nKardashian released a clip of the recording of their phone call shortly after West released his song “Famous,” which included a line where he posited he was the reason for Swift’s fame. That likely references their run-in at the 2009 VMAs, where he interrupted her acceptance speech for best female video.\n\nShare Pin 0 Shares\n\nTags ·Kim kardashian·taylor swift",

        "title": "Microsoft nearly fired engineer who added Windows Zip support, but it's a tricky situation",
        "text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works\n\nIt is always interesting when former Microsoft engineers or managers share their thoughts or stories on subject matters related to the company, mainly Windows. A couple of the most recent such incidents have not exactly been in Microsoft's favour though.\n\nOne of them called out the \"comically bad\" performance of Windows 11 and tried to draw the tech giant's attention towards the seemingly 'unfinished' state of the OS. Another ex-Windows head made a sarcastic comment at the company right after it started testing more ads and promos on the Start menu.\n\nThere are also instances where veterans share some interesting stories about various Windows components and how they came to be. Last month, Dave William Plummer, the author of several key Windows components and features like the Task Manager and Zip support, shared how he bought a Corvette at that time and that it was related to his work on the latter. You can read about that here.\n\nHowever, the Corvette was not a coincidence as Plummer has revealed in his new post which serves as a back-story. The luxury sports car was one of those things that motivated him when he was coding during the nights. The Microsoft residential area at that time had a person owning a 3,000 sq. ft. house with a Corvette parked in the driveway, and Plummer liked that, so much so that he said he plastered the Corvette's image on his monitor as a way to drive him so that he could one day drive a Corvette too.\n\nDave Plummer in his early days at Microsoft (Image credit: Dave Plummer)\n\nIf you are wondering what made him work at night, the ZIPFolders project was a side hustle Plummer was working on outside of his day job at Microsoft. It was inspired by an MSJ (Microsoft Systems Journal) magazine sample \"Big GAK\".\n\nIf you are wondering about moonlighting clauses, Plummer says Microsoft was fine with working on the side with the manager's approval as long as it was not on a product that was competing with the company, which was standard.\n\nThe friction started when Microsoft noticed Plummer began selling this shell extension program as a shareware called \"Visual Zip\" and someone at Microsoft took offence over it and complained to HR.\n\nWhat was funny about the situation was that Microsoft did not seem aware at that time that a Microsoft employee was doing this as a side hustle and as such the company was looking into acquiring the Visual Zip developer.\n\nUltimately, things resolved when Dave Plummer realized that it would be futile to refuse Microsoft's deal about adding the Zip component into Windows as that would mean he would not only have lost his job at Microsoft but also have had to compete with the company as he was working on competing products.\n\nHence, initial Zip support finally landed in Microsoft Plus! 95, which was an enhanced version of Windows 95, and it got better in Windows 98 and 2000.\n\nIf you find the bygone era of Windows and its apps interesting then you can read this story we covered recently wherein a talented geek painstakingly ported \"thousands of apps\" to Windows 95.\n\nSource: Dave Plummer (X / Twitter)",

        "text": "15 Graphs That Explain the State of AI in 2024\n\nEliza Strickland | IEEE Spectrum\n\n“Each year, the AI Index lands on virtual desks with a louder virtual thud—this year, its 393 pages are a testament to the fact that AI is coming off a really big year in 2023. For the past three years, IEEE Spectrum has read the whole damn thing and pulled out a selection of charts that sum up the current state of AI.”\n\nThe Next Frontier for Brain Implants Is Artificial Vision\n\nEmily Mullin | Wired\n\n“Elon Musk’s Neuralink and others are developing devices that could provide blind people with a crude sense of sight. …’This is not about getting biological vision back,’ says Philip Troyk, a professor of biomedical engineering at Illinois Tech, who’s leading the study Bussard is in. ‘This is about exploring what artificial vision could be.'”\n\nDIGITAL MEDIA\n\nMicrosoft’s VASA-1 Can Deepfake a Person With One Photo and One Audio Track\n\nBenj Edwards | Ars Technica\n\n“On Tuesday, Microsoft Research Asia unveiled VASA-1, an AI model that can create a synchronized animated video of a person talking or singing from a single photo and an existing audio track. In the future, it could power virtual avatars that render locally and don’t require video feeds—or allow anyone with similar tools to take a photo of a person found online and make them appear to say whatever they want.”\n\nMeta Is Already Training a More Powerful Successor to Llama 3\n\nWill Knight | Wired\n\n“On Thursday morning, Meta released its latest artificial intelligence model, Llama 3, touting it as the most powerful to be made open source so that anyone can use it. The same afternoon, Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, said an even more powerful successor to Llama is in the works. He suggested it could potentially outshine the world’s best closed AI models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini.”\n\nIntel Reveals World’s Biggest ‘Brain-Inspired’ Neuromorphic Computer\n\nMatthew Sparkes | New Scientist\n\n“Hala Point contains 1.15 billion artificial neurons across 1152 Loihi 2 achips, and is capable of 380 trillion synaptic operations per second. Mike Davies at Intel says that despite this power it occupies just six racks in a standard server case—a space similar to that of a microwave oven. Larger machines will be possible, says Davies. ‘We built this scale of system because, honestly, a billion neurons was a nice round number,’ he says. ‘I mean, there wasn’t any particular technical engineering challenge that made us stop at this level.'”\n\nUS Air Force Confirms First Successful AI Dogfight\n\nEmma Roth | The Verge\n\n“Human pilots were on board the X-62A with controls to disable the AI system, but DARPA says the pilots didn’t need to use the safety switch ‘at any point.’ The X-62A went against an F-16 controlled solely by a human pilot, where both aircraft demonstrated ‘high-aspect nose-to-nose engagements’ and got as close as 2,000 feet at 1,200 miles per hour. DARPA doesn’t say which aircraft won the dogfight, however.”\n\n\n\nCULTURE\n\nWhat If Your AI Girlfriend Hated You?\n\nKate Knibbs | Wired\n\n“It seems as though we’ve arrived at the moment in the AI hype cycle where no idea is too bonkers to launch. This week’s eyebrow-raising AI project is a new twist on the romantic chatbot—a mobile app called AngryGF, which offers its users the uniquely unpleasant experience of getting yelled at via messages from a fake person.”\n\nInsects and Other Animals Have Consciousness, Experts Declare\n\nDan Falk | Quanta\n\n“For decades, there’s been a broad agreement among scientists that animals similar to us—the great apes, for example—have conscious experience, even if their consciousness differs from our own. In recent years, however, researchers have begun to acknowledge that consciousness may also be widespread among animals that are very different from us, including invertebrates with completely different and far simpler nervous systems.”\n\nTwo Lifeforms Merge in Once-in-a-Billion-Years Evolutionary Event\n\nMichael Irving | New Atlas\n\n“Scientists have caught a once-in-a-billion-years evolutionary event in progress, as two lifeforms have merged into one organism that boasts abilities its peers would envy. Last time this happened, Earth got plants. …A species of algae called Braarudosphaera bigelowii was found to have engulfed a cyanobacterium that lets them do something that algae, and plants in general, can’t normally do—’fixing’ nitrogen straight from the air, and combining it with other elements to create more useful compounds.”\n\nImage Credit: Shubham Dhage / Unsplash",

        "text": "Here's Where You Can Watch Coraline\n\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\n\nHenry Selick's 2009 film \"Coraline\" was unique in the history of animation in that it was the first stop-motion feature to use 3-D printers to construct its maquettes. For Selick's 1993 hit \"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\" each character's individual face had to be hand-sculpted separately, requiring boxes and boxes of various Jack Skellington heads. 3-D printing for \"Coraline\" sped up the process and allowed the animators a wider variety of faces for the titular bratty girl and the terrifying adults in her life.\n\nThe story of \"Coraline\" was taken from Neil Gaiman's 2002 children's horror novel, itself heavily cribbing from Clive Barker's 1992 novel \"The Thief of Always.\" In the film, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) moves with her parents to a remote house out in the middle of the woods. Coraline makes no mystery of how much she hates the move, how much she hates her mom (Teri Hatcher) for forcing the issue, and hates deeply that she'll have no friends to play with. The local weirdo Wybie (Robert Bailey, Jr.) doesn't count. Then, while searching through the new home, Coraline finds a mysterious, long, birth-canal-like opening behind a tiny door. Passing through the breathing tunnel, Coraline emerges in a parallel version of her house where her mom is now kind and caring, and her every wish is catered to. The only creepy thing is that the new mom — her Other Mother (also Hatcher) — has buttons for eyes. Indeed, everyone in the parallel universe has button eyes.\n\nNaturally, something deeply sinister is afoot.\n\n\"Coraline\" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and put the animation studio, Laika, on the map. It's a wonderfully spooky film for aspiring Goth kids. It also has an original song by They Might Be Giants.\n\nHere's where you can watch it.",

        "text": "Angular is an open-source web application framework that uses JavaScript. Unlike some other frameworks or programming languages, you need to set up the environment variable in Windows for this framework to work. Hence, we must learn how to set up Angular in VS Code and write a demo code, that’s what we will do.\n\nHow to set up Angular in VS Code\n\nTo set up Angular in VS Code on your Windows computer, you need to follow the steps mentioned below.\n\nInstall Visual Studio Code Set up NodeJS Set up the Environment Variable Install Angular\n\nLet us talk about them in detail.\n\n1] Install Visual Studio Code\n\nTo get started with our coding journey in the Angular realm, we need to install Visual Studio Code. In order to do the same, you need to go to code.visualstudio.com and download the app for your environment. Once downloaded, go to the Download folder, run the installation media, and install the application.\n\n2] Set up NodeJS\n\nIt’s important to note that while you can use VSCode to edit Angular, you cannot run it directly within the editor. Angular is actually executed within NodeJS, which is a JavaScript environment that’s part of your local web development setup. With NodeJS, you can run Angular on your local host in a web browser. Every time you make changes to your Angular code in VSCode, it will automatically reload in the browser, which is known as “hot reload”. However, since Angular runs in NodeJS, you’ll need to install NodeJS first. You can do this by going to nodejs.org.\n\nWhen installing Node JS to run Angular, choose a location that is easy to remember, like a simple and short path. This will be helpful if you need to use NodeJS later. So, instead of installing the app in Program files, install it in D:\\NodeJS, albeit it doesn’t matter.\n\n3] Set up the environment variable\n\nNext up, we need to set up the environment variable for NodeJs before we go ahead and install Angular. To do the same, follow these steps.\n\nHit Win + S, type “Environment Variable” and then open it.\n\nOnce done, you need to copy the location of NodeJS. Just for reference, ours is D:\\NodeJS.\n\nClick on Environment Variable.\n\nNow, select Path in the System Variable section and click Edit.\n\nClick on New, paste the location, and click on Ok.\n\nThis way, you have entered the NodeJS Environment variable. To check if it’s working, open Command Prompt and then run node –version. If it gives you a version, we are good to install Angular.\n\n4] Install Angular\n\nAfter creating a proper environment by installing NodeJS, we will install Angular. Follow the steps mentioned below to do the same.\n\nOpen Visual Studio Code.\n\nNavigate to the location where you want to create an Angular file using the CD or Change Directory command. We have created a new directory in the D drive to create a project, check out the screenshot attached.\n\nTo install angular in the folder, we need to run the following command. npm install -g @angular/cli\n\nThen run the following command to create a new project. ng new foldername\n\nNow, get inside that folder using “cd foldername” and launch the server using ng serve.\n\nHopefully, now you can run Angular without any issues.\n\nRead: How to install JavaScript in VSCode?\n\nThis command is not available when running the Angular CLI outside a workspace\n\nWhen I ran the “ng serve” command I got an error that said the command was unavailable. Many people suspect that Angular is not installed on their system, whereas, in reality, the only problem is, that you are not in the correct directory. To resolve it, just do ‘cd’ to the directory where the project is located, not the root location but the actual project location. So, at first, when I ran the command, I was in AngularProject, which is my root folder, so it did not work. However, it worked seamlessly when I changed the directory to sampleFolder and ran the same command.\n\nA workaround that we would recommend you do is to open File Explorer, go to the location where your project is stored, right-click on the empty screen, and select Terminal > Command Prompt. And then run ng serve.\n\nRead: How to download and install Java JDK on Windows?\n\nHow to setup Angular project in Visual Studio Code?\n\nIn order to set up an Angular project, you first need to install NodeJS on your computer. Once done, you need to configure the Environment Variable and install Angular using the npm install -g @angular/cli command. Now, go ahead and create a new directory using ng new foldername command, to know more, check out the steps mentioned earlier.\n\nRead: How to configure VS Code for Microsoft C++\n\nHow to generate Angular VSCode?\n\nAngular File Generator is a handy extension for Visual Studio Code that enables you to create Angular files with just a few clicks. It is built on the Angular CLI and uses the same schematics as the CLI. Additionally, it provides an option to generate files right from the terminal.\n\nAlso Read: How to install Python in VS Code.",

        "text": "基础知识\n\n命名空间和子命名空间\n\n我们可以把namespace理解为一个单独的空间，事实上它也就是一个空间而已，子命名空间那就是空间里再划分几个小空间，举个例子：\n\n<?php namespace animal\\cat; class cat{ public function __construct() { echo \"meow\".\"\n\n\"; } } namespace animal\\dogA; class dog{ public function __construct() { echo \"A:wooffff\".\"\n\n\"; } } namespace animal\\dogB; class dog { public function __construct() { echo \"B:wooffff\".\"\n\n\"; } } namespace animal\\dogC; class dog { public function __construct() { echo \"C:wooffff\".\"\n\n\"; } } new dog(); //下面输出的都是dogA new \\animal\\dogA\\dog(); use animal\\dogA; new dogA\\dog(); use animal\\dogA as alias; new alias\\dog(); //输出cat use animal\\cat\\cat; new cat();\n\n\n\n当有多个子命名空间有相同名称类时，不指定使用哪个命名空间的情况下取最后定义的命名空间中的类，比如上面的 dog 取的时 dogC 中的类，在上面的例子中 animal 是一个命名空间， animal\\cat animal\\dogA animal\\dogB animal\\dogC 都是其子命名空间，可以看到这样一共就存在四个命名空间，而使用各个命名空间的方法就是将命名空间的名字写完整，use是什么意思呢？其实和include和require有点像，就是在当前命名空间引入其他命名空间的别名，比如 use animal\\dogA as alias 其中的alias就是别名。 use animal\\cat\\cat 这句话就是直接指定了 animal\\cat 命名空间的 cat 类了，我们只需要直接new就可以创建cat对象，不需要在前面加命名空间\n\n类的继承\n\n这个简单讲下，php中是通过 extend 关键字实现类的继承的，子类可以覆盖父类的方法，子类也可以通过 parent:: 关键字访问父类被覆盖的方法\n\n<?php class father{ public $name=\"Json\"; private $age=30; public $hobby=\"game\"; public function say(){ echo \"i am father\n\n\"; } public function smoke(){ echo \"i got smoke\n\n\"; } } class son extends father{ public $name=\"Boogipop\"; private $age=19; public function say() { echo \"i am son\n\n\"; } public function parentsay(){ parent::say(); } } $son=new son(); $son->say(); $son->smoke(); $son->parentsay(); echo $son->hobby;\n\ntrait修饰符\n\ntrait修饰符使得被修饰的类可以进行复用，增加了代码的可复用性，使用这个修饰符就可以在一个类包含另一个类\n\n<?php trait test{ public function test(){ echo \"test\n\n\"; } } class impl{ use test; public function __construct() { echo \"impl\n\n\"; } } $t=new impl(); $t->test(); // 输出 impl test\n\n我们在impl类中use了test这个类，因此我们可以调用其中的方法，有点抽象的意思\n\nThinkphp开发手册\n\nThinkphp5开发手册\n\n不懂就查\n\nThinkphp5.0.22 RCE漏洞\n\n测试\n\nPOC： POST：_method=__construct&filter=system&server[REQUEST_METHOD]=whoami\n\n\n\n前提是debug选项要开启\n\n\n\n流程分析\n\n下断点调试，入口就在 public/index.php 中\n\n\n\n跟进 start.php\n\n\n\n进入run方法\n\n\n\n跟进routeCheck方法，没什么大用，直接定位到 Request.php 中的 method 方法\n\n\n\n注意 $_POST[Config::get('var_method')] ，进入 Config::get 分析一下逻辑\n\n\n\n其实返回的就是 _method ，然后退出来回到method方法中， $this->method 对应的就是 $_POST['_method'] ，我们传入的是 __construct ，转为大写之后就是 __CONSTRUCT ，然后调用 $this->{$this->method}($_POST) ，也就是 $this->__CONSTRUCT($_POST) ，进入\n\n\n\n这里开始遍历POST的元素，注意 $this->$name ，这个写法很明显有变量覆盖的漏洞，这里轻松的覆盖掉 $this->filter 和 $this->server ，继续往后走，进入 dispatch\n\n\n\n没啥东西，退出往下走\n\n\n\n这里得开启了 debug 才能进入，我们进入 param 方法\n\n\n\n又进入 method 方法\n\n\n\n进入 server 方法\n\n\n\n进入 input 方法\n\n\n\n这里给 $data=\"whoami\" ，然后进入 getFilter 方法\n\n\n\n最终 $filter=['system', null] ，退出\n\n\n\n进入 filterValue 方法\n\n\n\n调用了 call_user_func ，执行命令\n\nThinkphp5.1.x反序列化链\n\n环境搭建\n\n准备一个反序列化入口：\n\n<?php namespace app\\index\\controller;

(Making the switch also gives you a security boost, especially if you max out Safari’s privacy settings.)\n\nIt’s not just Google Chrome itself, either. Apps like Slack, Discord, Spotify, Microsoft Teams and many others are made using the Chrome browser engine, too. But there’s a solution to this problem: Instead of using the official versions of those apps, you can open them and sign in from Safari, then click File > Add to Dock.\n\nThen you’ll be able to run your web apps in their own windows, just like before, but with the energy-efficient Safari powering them instead.\n\n2. Check what apps are running in the background on your slow Mac\n\nIt’s good to keep an eye on what’s running in the background, especially if your Mac is running slow. It could be that you’ve installed a bunch of apps over the years, and one of them is still churning away in the background even though you never use it.\n\nYou can find this information in System Settings > General > Login Items.\n\nOn top, you’ll see apps that launch automatically when you sign in to your Mac. You can click to select one and click the − button to remove it. Below, you’ll see a list of apps allowed to run in the background. Simply uncheck them to turn them off.\n\nOther background activities are built into macOS itself. There’s no easy way to turn them off without digging into the Terminal, but you should be aware of them:\n\nIf you sync your photo library to your Mac, it’ll download new pictures and videos in the background and scan through them to identify people and pets.\n\nSpotlight, the universal search box that can find files, apps, messages, email and more, occasionally needs to scan your Mac to find if there’s anything new.\n\n3. Your slow Mac is simply too old\n\nMacs last a really, really long time — and that’s both a blessing and a curse. I used my 2015 MacBook Pro for eight years, even as its battery started swelling. Now, it’s probably a fire hazard.\n\nApple releases a major new version of macOS every year. And updating can make an older Mac run slowly. If you keep using an older version (while still installing Apple’s minor security updates), your Mac might run a little faster. (Or, at least, stop getting slower.) Major new releases with new features can slow down an older computer.\n\nToward the end of the period when Apple sold computers with Intel chips — let’s say from 2014 to 2020 — there were some pretty bad Macs. The 2014 to 2018 Mac mini is legitimately one of the worst Macs ever made. If you own one of those, I’m sorry.\n\nThe good news is that new Macs with Apple silicon chips inside are lightning-fast and relatively inexpensive. Walmart sells the M1 MacBook Air for just $699. And if you want to save more with a desktop, you can pick up an M1 Mac mini for around $500.\n\n4. Your Mac is overheating\n\nIf your Mac starts getting warm, it will automatically slow down (aka “throttle”) the processor to keep it from getting too hot. Normally, your Mac will only throttle itself if you’re doing something really intense, like exporting a video. It can be frustrating if your Mac slows down in the middle of your regular work.\n\nIn an older MacBook, the vents can become blocked by dust over time and cause overheating. That’s pretty easy to fix. Carefully unscrew and remove the MacBook’s bottom case. Then use a vacuum cleaner or a can of compressed air to clear out all the visible dust.\n\nIn ordinary usage, it’s rare for a newer MacBook Air with Apple silicon to be pushed to its limits, but it can still happen. Since these laptops doesn’t come with an internal fan, you can boost their performance with a cooling pad.\n\nThis model sold on Amazon costs only $25. When you’re at your desk, you can put your MacBook on top of it. The cooling pad’s fans will keep cool air blowing underneath, where a MacBook Air gets the hottest. This particular cooling pad doubles as a USB hub, so plugging it into your Mac gives you two USB ports as well.\n\n5. You don’t have enough memory (or storage)\n\nMost Macs made in the last 10 years start with just 8GB of memory on the base model. Upgrading to 16GB or more is one of the most important upgrades you can make when buying a Mac, but a lot of people skip it. You can upgrade the RAM on some older Macs, but not on any recent ones running on Apple silicon.\n\nThe bad news is, if you have too many apps open at once, other apps you have open will be pushed out of memory. And that can really make your Mac run slowly if you’re trying to multitask. Short of splurging on extra memory with your next Mac, unfortunately, the only solution when this happens is to quit big apps you’re not using.\n\nThis problem can be compounded if your Mac is running low on storage, too. Usually, when your Mac is running low on memory, background apps will be offloaded into storage — but if you don’t have enough storage, that can cause more problems. Here’s what to do if you need to clear up space on your Mac.\n\nRead more about your Mac\n\nCheck out more Mac tips:",

        "title": "Dell XPS 14 (9440)",
        "text": "Dell's consumer flagship XPS laptops always flaunt an extra-fancy feature or two. (We're glad these days it's an LED touch-strip key row instead of a webcam aimed up your nose.) The new XPS 14 (model 9440, starting at $1,699; $2,099 as tested) shows off the flashy top row and seamless haptic touchpad that premiered in the Dell XPS 13 Plus, plus Intel's latest AI-enhanced silicon and Microsoft's dedicated key for AI-enhanced Windows Copilot. The Dell XPS 14 is a sleek and swift performer, but its only advantages over other slimline laptops are a barely larger 14.5-inch display and an optional discrete GPU for more content-creation performance. With that, the Asus Zenbook 14X OLED (UX3404) remains our Editors' Choice award holder for high-end ultraportable laptops, while Asus' own Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406) presents a similar experience for half the XPS 14's price.\n\nConfigurations and Design: Meteor Lake or Bust\n\nWhile Intel's Core Ultra 7 155H is the only processor choice you have at checkout, our review unit has the $400-extra 6GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 in place of the standard Intel Arc integrated graphics. Otherwise, this unit has base-model specs with 16GB of memory, a 512GB NVMe solid-state drive, Windows 11 Home, and an IPS screen with a 1,920-by-1,200-pixel resolution and variable 60Hz or 120Hz refresh rate (no touch control here). A tempting $300 OLED touch panel with a 3,200-by-2,000-pixel resolution is available as an option.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe XPS 14's memory- and storage-ceiling options are dense (64GB and 4TB respectively). Relatively speaking, so is the laptop's body, weighing 3.7 pounds (3.8 for OLED models), offsetting its trim size of 0.71 by 12.6 by 8.5 inches. By contrast, the HP Pavilion Plus 14 hits the scale at 3.04 pounds, and the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch qualifies as an ultraportable at 2.82 pounds.\n\nCrafted from CNC machined aluminum in either Graphite (black) or Platinum, the Dell exhibits almost no flex if you torque the screen corners or press the keyboard deck. What the company calls an InfinityEdge display has fashion-model-thin bezels, though I was dismayed that the webcam centered above the screen has neither a sliding privacy shutter nor a keyboard camera-kill command. The camera has IR face recognition, which coupled with a fingerprint-reader power button gives you two ways to skip typing passwords with Windows Hello.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nLike other Dell XPS notebooks, not to mention Apple Macbooks, the XPS 14 relies on USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports—two on the left edge and one on the right, the latter joined by an audio jack (shamefully missing from the Dell XPS 13) and a microSD card slot.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe laptop lacks USB Type-A and HDMI monitor ports, but you get one of each on a clever little dongle that, like the AC adapter, plugs into a USB-C port. You'll find no mobile broadband option here, but Intel Killer Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth come standard.\n\nUsing the Dell XPS 14: An Invisible Touchpad\n\nAs on the XPS 13 Plus, the XPS 14 keyboard is a voguish lattice, a rectangle sliced into flush-fitting squares instead of raised or separate keys. Even when its backlighting is turned off, the top row of LED icons is illuminated. Along with the Escape and Delete keys as well as volume and brightness controls, the row includes Home and End keys, though Page Up and Page Down are combinations of the Fn key and up and down cursor arrows. These arrow keys are sadly half-size keys stacked between full-size left and right arrows, in the awkward row instead of the proper inverted T that I always complain about in HP laptop reviews.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nDell's keyboard looks better than it feels: It's quiet and responsive but noticeably shallow and stiff. I make more than my usual amount of errors with these keys, and they would be uncomfortable to type on for hours. By contrast, the seamless glass touchpad was friendlier than I expected; it's placed so that muscle memory proves quite accurate for right-clicking (a tap at the bottom right), and it has a comfortable haptic click.\n\nThe webcam records in 1080p resolution and supports the recently added Windows Studio Effects for automatic framing, eye-contact adjustment, and background blurring. It's an above-average camera, capturing well-lit images even on a dark overcast day; we noted vivid color and no annoying noise or static.\n\nDell's entry-level IPS screen is impressively bright, with clean white backgrounds, though it doesn't tilt back quite as far as I'd like. The display's colors are rich and well-saturated, and it shows decently deep contrast and wide viewing angles. The screen's details are sharp with no pixelation around the edges of letters.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nPreinstalled on the system, the MyDell app works with the webcam to provide presence detection, locking and waking the PC as you walk away and return. This duo also protects your privacy by dimming the screen if you look away. MyDell also lets you fine-tune screen color tweaks such as gamma and temperature; choose optimized, quiet, or high-performance modes for cooling and fan noise; and launch a Killer networking dashboard to prioritize traffic for different apps and choose the strongest available Wi-Fi access point.\n\nOne more MyDell feature lets you toggle 3D audio effects and pick from equalizer profiles ranging from acoustic and jazz to metal and hip-hop. A set of 8-watt quad speakers pumps out loud but rather hollow audio. You'll hear a bit more bass than most laptops can muster, but drumbeats sound flat—at least it's easy to make out overlapping tracks.\n\nTesting the Dell XPS 14: Dedicated Graphics Don't Always Dazzle\n\nWhile the XPS 14 stands alone with a 14.5-inch display, you'll find plenty of 14-inch competitors on both sides of the 3-pound line that serves as our ultraportable cutoff. The Lenovo Slim 7i 14 Gen 9 and the Acer Swift Go 14 join the Dell in housing an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H CPU and a 1,920-by-1,200-pixel screen, though the Lenovo laptop has OLED instead of IPS tech. The abovementioned HP Pavilion Plus 14 and Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406) rely on AMD Ryzen instead of Intel processors.\n\nProductivity Tests\n\nWe run the same general productivity benchmarks across both mobile and desktop systems. Our first test is UL's PCMark 10, which simulates a variety of real-world productivity and office workflows to measure overall system performance and also includes a storage subtest for the primary drive.\n\nThree more benchmarks focus on the CPU, using all available cores and threads, to rate a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Maxon's Cinebench R23 uses that company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene, while Geekbench 5.5 Pro from Primate Labs simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning. We also use the open-source video transcoder HandBrake 1.4 to convert a 12-minute video clip from 4K to 1080p resolution (lower times are better).\n\nFinally, we run PugetBench for Photoshop by workstation maker Puget Systems, which uses the Creative Cloud version 22 of Adobe's famous image editor to rate a PC's performance for content creation and multimedia applications. It's an automated extension that executes a variety of general and GPU-accelerated Photoshop tasks ranging from opening, rotating, resizing, and saving an image to applying masks, gradient fills, and filters.\n\nAll five slimlines easily cleared the 4,000 points in PCMark 10, signaling excellent mainstream productivity for Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace. The XPS 14 performed well enough in our CPU tests and posted a competitive score in Photoshop; it's not meant for demanding workstation apps but is a fine choice as a daily driver.\n\nHowever, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch edged out the XPS 14 in several tests here, pointing toward competitive processing performance from AMD in this latest generation. Even more important, however, is that this Zenbook kept up with the XPS 14 for less than half the price at just $800 at the time of writing.\n\nGraphics Tests\n\nWe test each Windows PC's graphics with two DirectX 12 gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark, Night Raid (more modest, suitable for laptops with integrated graphics) and Time Spy (more demanding, suitable for gaming rigs with discrete GPUs).\n\nAdditionally, we run two tests from the cross-platform GPU benchmark GFXBench 5, which stresses both low-level routines like texturing and high-level, game-like image rendering. The 1440p Aztec Ruins and 1080p Car Chase tests are rendered offscreen to accommodate different display resolutions as well as exercise graphics and compute shaders using the OpenGL programming interface and hardware tessellation, respectively. The more frames per second (fps), the better.\n\nThe Dell's GeForce GPU predictably outran its rivals' integrated graphics in three of our four tests, though it laid down and died in Night Raid—a baffling lapse, since I tried the benchmark several times and configured Windows to use the RTX 4050 instead of Intel Arc Graphics. The others were hollow victories, with the XPS 14 underperforming by discrete-graphics standards, possibly because Dell's specs say the GPU is tuned to a tiny 30W.\n\nThis GPU wattage and performance weakens one of the Dell XPS 14's advantages as a nearly ultraportable laptop for creators. It should be enough to drive photo editing work, which might be this laptop's niche focus, but more intense visual work, like video editing and 3D content creation, would be better served by a higher-wattage chip.\n\nBattery and Display Tests\n\nWe test each laptop's battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie Tears of Steel) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test, with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off.\n\nTo gauge display performance, we also use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and its Windows software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation—what percentage of the sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show—and its 50% and peak brightness in nits (candelas per square meter).\n\nThe XPS almost tied the Zenbook for the win in our battery rundown, with more than enough stamina to get you through an all-day workday. It joined the other IPS system, the Acer, in trailing the OLED displays but showed suitable color coverage for anything short of pre-press or professional graphics, and it was the brightest screen in the testing quintet.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nVerdict: High Fashion, High Price\n\nDell doesn't make bad laptops, and the XPS 14 is an attractive, even elegant productivity partner with epic battery life. Unfortunately, it doesn't contend for Editors' Choice honors. Comparing base model with base model, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch crushes it on value. The Zenbook provides more-vivid color and contrast (with OLED versus IPS screen technology); it performs about as well, short of graphics tasks; it's about a pound lighter; and it costs $900 less. (Likewise, Asus fills the high-end ultraportable Editors' Choice slot with its still slightly cheaper Zenbook 14X OLED.) If you need an ultraportable laptop for photo editing specifically and little else creatively, then maybe the XPS 14 is a fit for you. Otherwise, Asus and even Apple have more affordable alternatives for that performance niche.",

(Likewise, Asus fills the high-end ultraportable Editors' Choice slot with its still slightly cheaper Zenbook 14X OLED.) If you need an ultraportable laptop for photo editing specifically and little else creatively, then maybe the XPS 14 is a fit for you. Otherwise, Asus and even Apple have more affordable alternatives for that performance niche.",
        "summary": "Dell's consumer flagship XPS laptops always flaunt an extra-fancy feature or two. ( We're glad these days it's an LED touch-strip key row instead of a webcam aimed up your nose.) With that, the Asus Zenbook 14X OLED (UX3404) remains our Editors' Choice award holder for high-end ultraportable laptops, while Asus' own Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406) presents a similar experience for half the XPS 14's price. (Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nDell's keyboard looks better than it feels: It's quiet and responsive but noticeably shallow and stiff. The webcam records in 1080p resolution and supports the recently added Windows Studio Effects for automatic framing, eye-contact adjustment, and background blurring. It's an above-average camera, capturing well-lit images even on a dark overcast day; we noted vivid color and no annoying noise or static. The display's colors are rich and well-saturated, and it shows decently deep contrast and wide viewing angles. The abovementioned HP Pavilion Plus 14 and Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406) rely on AMD Ryzen instead of Intel processors. Three more benchmarks focus on the CPU, using all available cores and threads, to rate a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Finally, we run PugetBench for Photoshop by workstation maker Puget Systems, which uses the Creative Cloud version 22 of Adobe's famous image editor to rate a PC's performance for content creation and multimedia applications. The others were hollow victories, with the XPS 14 underperforming by discrete-graphics standards, possibly because Dell's specs say the GPU is tuned to a tiny 30W.\n\nThis GPU wattage and performance weakens one of the Dell XPS 14's advantages as a nearly ultraportable laptop for creators. The XPS almost tied the Zenbook for the win in our battery rundown, with more than enough stamina to get you through an all-day workday. Unfortunately, it doesn't contend for Editors' Choice honors. Otherwise, Asus and even Apple have more affordable alternatives for that performance niche."

        "text": "News Glory Hunters Looks Like A Game Boy Zelda, And Plays Like Nothing Else Well, it plays a bit like Zelda too\n\nSubscribe to Nintendo Life on YouTube 764k\n\nWow! So you’re creating the game with GB Studio? Is this a completely solo effort or are you making it as part of a team?\n\nThe game is being created in GB Studio version 3.1.0, using tiles to create the map, sprites for NPCs, and animations. I partnered with my neighbour Rodrigo Nuñez – he’s a musician and is a part of a Celtic music band, so he knew a lot about the tunes used for that mood. I told him about the game and he created over 23 tracks. After that he recreated the original soundtrack with his band which you can hear on Spotify. I also teamed up with a good friend who I worked with on Pato Box, his name is Antonio Gutierrez and he’s dedicated to porting the game once I’m finished. Everything else, the sprites, the story, the programming I am doing myself.\n\nGB Studio is of course designed to be very user-friendly, have you found that you’re bumping up against its limitations at all or is it doing everything that you want it to do?\n\nIt obviously has some limitations. For example, having to optimise the game so it fits into 4mb is quite the challenge. People are always surprised at how small that is, smaller than pictures on a phone sometimes. The game will last around 24 hours, that part was really challenging. It is really easy because it’s drag-and-drop but as I didn’t have any experience as a programmer, I don’t know any language code so I needed to get familiarised with the process – the logic of creating the game.\n\nYou were kind enough to share a demo build with us and I was really struck by the progression system. It reminded me of The Frog for Whom the Bell Tolls – not that you progress in the same way, but in that it feels familiar to something like The Legend of Zelda but with a vastly different approach to navigating through the world.\n\nI played a bit of that while researching for the game. The controls play like the first Legend of Zelda because I couldn’t make something really complex with the limitations. The currency system you could compare to an EXP points system – I studied a lot about how Dragon Quest 1 worked and translated that into achievement points instead of experience by killing enemies. The visuals are based on games like Final Fantasy Adventure, and Link’s Awakening. Some of the assets are based on the Mother series and even Pokémon.\n\nHow did the idea for the achievement system come about?\n\nI’m a World of Warcraft player so for me the achievement system within video games started there, but the idea was really born from A Link to the Past on the SNES – a specific part in the game when you had to drop rupees over and over again to upgrade bombs and arrows and I remember always as a kid trying to do that first. It was grindy but I really enjoyed having that reward of repeating the same action over and over again. That was the origin of the idea for Glory Hunters – to have certain events or challenges that you could repeat over again and scale into experience or currency you could use to open the world freely. That’s evolved but it’s the origin of the idea.\n\nThe game is having a physical release through Bitmap Soft – how did that partnership come about?\n\nI joined the first GB competition on itch.io in 2021 and the demo was a finalist among 137 entries. After that I was contacted on Twitter by Bitmap Soft which was one of four or five publishers at the time creating new games for retro consoles. They said they were interested in the game, I told them I loved their games and that would be awesome - but I wanted to create a Kickstarter to reach more people. Together we figured out the campaign, I would create the game and they would make it physically for all the backers, and after that they would keep producing the game based on demand. The Kickstarter was in 2022 and we made about 130% of our target.\n\nHow is development going? Are you confident in reaching your 2024 target?\n\nOriginally development was meant to last one year but my second son was due to come into the world. Mixing children with all that happened with COVID, having COVID myself – a lot of issues has meant we are now two years into development.\n\nFinally, while we’ve been chatting I can’t help but admire that Game Boy behind you – it’s enormous!\n\nYeah, it’s about one metre tall. It actually works – we’ve been taking it to events with original Game Boys for people to try out the game. It’s a lot of work creating an indie game without any money, but it’s been awesome to see people playing it.\n\nWhat I’ve noticed is that many of the people who are interested in the game or the Kickstarter seem to be parents, people like me who grew up with a Game Boy, a simple system with a few buttons. They want a new experience with a familiar console and to share that with their kids. I’ve created the game with that in mind. You can get gratification in short bursts because parents don’t have a lot of time. You can complete the game within a few hours by getting to one corner of the map and defeating a god, but then if you want to go deeper down the rabbit hole it’ll take a lot more time. There’s an unlock and a ‘good’ ending. I’d love to know how many people see it.\n\nNext up is Matt Hughson, whose game-dev day job has him working at The Coalition. A prolific designer in the homebrew NES scene, Matt took on the challenge of porting one of his best-known titles, From Below, to the Game Boy using the ZGB and GBDK2020 libraries.\n\nNintendo Life: Hi Matt, tell us a bit about yourself and how you got into developing games.\n\nMatt Hughson: I’m in my 40s so I grew up with the NES, Game Boy, all that stuff – that’s kind of a cornerstone of my childhood, the heyday of Mario Mania. After childhood I got pretty into the NES in the late '90s when emulation kind of exploded, I ran some emulation websites and then went to Full Sail School in Florida for game design where I earned my degree. Despite its name it is not a sailing school, which seems to confuse everyone I talk to, they teach digital media which is super common now but when I went back in 2001 it was quite a novelty, there were no game programs at national universities, it was really only Digipen and Full Sail. From there I came back to Canada, first working in a school then transferring to Electronic Arts - bouncing around companies in Vancouver and I’m now at Microsoft working on the Gears of War franchise.\n\nYou mention your love for the NES – I believe you’ve made games for the NES before?\n\nYeah, as I mentioned I’ve been working for about 20 years professionally in the industry and then I started getting into NES development around 2020 just as a hobby thing. I released From Below for the NES in 2020, then my next game was Witch n’ Wiz, kind of a puzzle platformer also for the NES. Then I switched over to the Game Boy for From Below Pocket. Now I’m back on the NES for an action platformer called Super Sunny World which is a kind of love letter to NES Mario games.\n\nSubscribe to Nintendo Life on YouTube 764k\n\nYou ported From Below from the NES to the Game Boy – what made you decide to do this and what challenges did you face when porting it?\n\nI guess the root motivation was that I love the Game Boy. And I think maybe a technical reason I was interested in doing a port was because I write most of my games in C instead of Assembly – which most old games were written in. Now to rewrite them in C you pay the cost of performance. I wrote From Below for the NES 99% in C with some bits from some Assembly libraries and then there are also libraries for the Game Boy which allow you to compile C, so I could take the core engine and just compile the game on the Game Boy with little to no work for the core gameplay. So that interested me, the thought that I could take the exact same game and run it on Game Boy – though there’s obviously a lot more work to it than that.\n\nThe two biggest challenges were the resolution change and the multiplayer. It’s lower resolution than the NES, the Game Boy’s about 144 [pixels] high and 160 wide whereas the NES is 256 by 240 – so basically cut in half. In addition to that, for the Tetris-style gameplay the traditional board is 10 blocks wide and 20 blocks high; on the Game Boy render is 8x8 sprites, so if you do the math you can’t actually fit that in on the Game Boy screen.\n\nSo if you look at the Nintendo Tetris board for the Game Boy, it is only 10 wide and 18 high, which is not really the traditional gameplay - so I wanted to kind of fix that. I did a bunch of technical tricks to essentially squish the screen so instead of being 144 pixels high it’s about 180 pixels high and I do it by skipping rendering every 8th scanline – so instead of 8x8 sprites, it’s essentially 8x7 sprites. So if you look closely the blocks aren’t actually square they’re slightly squished. That was a bit of a technical challenge and it kind of messes with the logic a little but it means that From Below is, as far as I know, the only game on the Game Boy that has the full 10x20 game board.\n\nOn top of that I wanted to add multiplayer and that was by far the hardest part of the game – a peer-to-peer game where you’re sending one byte at a time, it’s really complicated. And I had it easy! I had libraries I was building on top of and a lot of the low-level stuff was done for me but there were still tons of bugs and loads of edge cases to deal with.\n\nThe Game Boy is well known for its block puzzle games – you’ve mentioned the full-size board which makes it unique amongst its predecessors but tell us a little more about it and what makes it different.\n\nSo the core hook is this Kraken monster at the bottom of the screen and he’s pushing his tentacles up from the bottom of the ocean onto the gameboard. As he does so he’s pushing a row of blocks up as well as leaving garbage blocks on the board while you’re clearing. If you clear a line over his tentacle he retreats – so this push and pull adds a twist to it. And on top of that, there’s the idea that sometimes he can help you – he can push blocks into empty spaces which normally you wouldn’t be able to reach, so you can use him to your advantage as well.\n\nOne of the core design philosophies I was aiming for was taking modern design sensibilities and adding them to this classic game, so if you play classic Tetris or Game Boy Tetris, there are a lot of modern things that you might forget or might not realise are missing – things like wall kicks, lock delay so you can slide the block when it lands, little things like that to make it feel really good and fluid. Recently someone played Tetris for hours and hours to ‘beat’ the game – you can play at the highest level and it never gets harder. To combat that scenario and keep the games relatively short, once you reach level 30 there’s basically a soft kill screen. So every level you beat the floor slowly rises so you have a smaller space to work with. By the time you reach level 40 you’re essentially forced to play in the top third of the level while everything below it is locked – it’s basically impossible because it’s lightning fast at that point too, but it’s intentional to make it so you get as many points as you can before that point and then you have a bit of a 'soft' chance to maybe score a few more lines. At that point, lines in Tetris are worth tons of points so it just ensures that nobody’s going to have to play this game for four hours to get the world record. The longest play is 20 minutes or so.\n\nAs I ended up nearing completion, a bunch of the hardcore NES Tetris players found it and they started giving me feedback so a lot of what I’ve talked about is from them. I had no idea that stuff existed, I just kept feeding off them and pushing more and more into the game until it felt really good. I’m so thankful they found it because there was lots of stuff that was totally broken that would’ve just ruined the game for high-level Tetris players.\n\nDo you have a world record scoreboard currently?\n\nI think it’s two million. It’s on my Discord – I keep it there. I think someone hit that last year, which is just insane to me.\n\nYou had a limited run on cartridges – did you do that yourself or were they produced for you?\n\nIt was a bit of a mix. For the original NES game I did a super limited run of 100 copies and the first 50 I basically did myself. I contacted a guy on Etsy who made boxes and they turned out to be in Vancouver. I bought the PCBs from Broke Studio in France and I ordered the shells from China. It was an amalgamation for that first 50 which was a ton of work and really stressful, and if one doesn’t work you’re kind of screwed.\n\nSo for the second run I just went through Broke Studio because they also do the complete-in-box service, the shipping and everything. I did eBay for those batches; for the Game Boy version and a rerelease of the NES version I set up my own store, took all the orders, and passed that on to Broke Studio who did the manufacturing and distribution for me. Witch n’ Wiz before went through Limited Run Games.\n\nSubscribe to Nintendo Life on YouTube 764k\n\nSuper Sunny World for the NES is your current project – what’s the release date for that and do you have any plans for the Game Boy after that?\n\nI’m hoping to release this summer. When I started it was meant to be a one-month project – that was a year ago. I wanted to do something quick, a little homage to Mario 1, but it went so well that I decided to keep working on it. It’s really close to done – I have all the levels done, all the core gameplay is done, I’m just working on bosses which is taking a long time and I want to do some meta-game stuff. Finding hidden collectibles, maybe a slot machine to buy in-game items like Smash Bros. – something like that.\n\nThen I’d love to return to Game Boy. I’d love to do a Witch n’ Wiz port. It's kind of like a spiritual successor to Catrap – it takes the core concept of Catrap for the first ten levels but then every ten levels after I switch the mechanics. You can loop around the edge of the screen for the next ten levels like Asteroids, later on you can flip gravity. Catrap was such an awesome game I feel like Witch n’ Wiz would be too. I was also thinking of doing a Super Sunny port like a Super Sunny Land similar to Super Mario Land – not a straight port but a reimagining on a smaller screen. I just need to get this done first!\n\nFinally, 7FH has seen five physical Game Boy releases in a variety of different genres and is a dab hand at squeezing magic out of the tiny portable using the GBDK2020 library.\n\nNintendo Life: Hi 7FH, tell us a bit about yourself and how you got into developing.\n\n7FH: I'm 42 and come from Germany. Around 2019, I discovered the GBDK (Game Boy Development Kit), which allows you to develop your own Game Boy games using C. I was fascinated by the idea of creating my own game, so I looked around for tutorials and code examples.\n\nYou’re a prolific Game Boy creator with five physical releases to date. Tell us a little about each game.\n\nAll my games are developed using the GBDK. It delivers only a few basic functions but no complete game engine. Developing the game engine is one of the most fun parts.\n\nGenesis (2020) is a vertical scrolling shoot ‘em up mostly inspired by Solar Striker.\n\nBlack Castle (2020) is an action platformer. It’s said to be a mixture of Super Mario Land and Castlevania.\n\nGunship (2021) is a vertical-scrolling rail shooter. This type of game hardly exists on the Game Boy, which prompted me to develop such a game.\n\nG-Zero (2022) is a F-Zero-like racing game. I found one day an F-Zero pixel art demake on the internet which inspired me.\n\nGenesis 2 (2024) is the successor to Genesis. Genesis got some bad reviews... it was my first game and I didn’t know the hardware that well yet. So I wanted to prove that I can do it better.\n\nDo any of the other games draw inspiration from other Game Boy titles you’ve enjoyed?\n\nGenesis 1 and 2 also take inspiration from Nemesis 1 and 2. You can tell that from the name alone. Black Castle picks up on some elements of the Ghost 'n Goblins game series.",

        "title": "Living With the Dell XPS 14",
        "text": "The combination of an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H (Meteor Lake) CPU and Nvidia GTX 4050 graphics gives the Dell XPS 14 a lot of power, and the basic design certainly looks sleek with a rather flat keyboard, invisible touchpad, and function keys indicated by lights rather than physical keys. The model I tested had a wonderful 14.5-inch touch OLED display that looked great. All that power comes at a price, and the keyboard will attract some users, while turning others off.\n\nMeasuring 12.6 x 8.5 x 0.71 inches, the XPS 14 (9440) is just barely larger than the X1 Carbon Gen 12 and a bit smaller than the HP x360 Spectre 14. It looks good in CNC aluminum and is available in either a lighter platinum or a darker graphite shade; I used the former, and it looked quite good. The 14.5-inch display has very small bezels and is on a hinge that drops down, so you don’t see as much of the bezel as on other machines, with the hinge leaving room for air vents on the bottom of the unit. In short, it looks very modern.\n\nProbably because of the included discrete graphics, it’s heavier than the other machines I mentioned – my model, which had an OLED display, weighs 3.87 pounds (4.59 pounds with the included 100-watt charger), about 1.5 pounds more than the X1 Carbon. But it’s still rather sleek, and the weight is light compared to most machines with this level of graphics.\n\nAs mentioned, the keyboard will be controversial. It has a seamless glass touchpad, with haptic feedback and a Gorilla Glass cover. You don’t see the outlines of the touchpad area, but it reaches from the Windows key to the backspace, a larger area than on almost any laptop I’ve seen. Instead of traditional function key buttons, it has a capacitive touch function row, in which lights show you the various functions. All the essential keys are there, but since they don't change, I'm not quite sure about the benefit this offers for users. I wish it had indicator lights showing you when the speakers are muted. But it does allow for more cooling, which is important because of the graphics.\n\nThe backlit keyboard itself is flatter than I’m used to, but the keys are large with little room between them, and with 0.3mm travel, it’s an improvement from similar keyboards I’ve seen in the past. This is one of the first laptops I've used that has a dedicated physical Microsoft Copilot key, and that worked fine. Overall, the keyboard took a little getting used to, but I could touch type on it without difficulty.\n\nThe version of the XPS 14 I tested is based on the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H (Meteor Lake), which Dell says is running at 30 watts in this configuration. The 7 155H includes six \"performance\" cores, each capable of running two threads, and eight \"efficient\" cores on the main CPU tile, along with two additional \"low-power efficient\" cores on a separate tile. The performance cores have a base frequency of 1.4GHz and a maximum turbo of 4.8GHz. For graphics, the Intel processor has Intel Arc Graphics, which means eight Xe graphics cores; it includes Intel’s AI Boost with an NPU. Of course, if you want great graphics, you’ll use the internal Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050, which comes with 6 GB of GDDR6 memory and can run at up to 30 watts. Combined, the system can use up to 47 watts, with the power distributed, depending on the application. The system I tested came with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.\n\nThe combination yields good to great performance, depending on the application. On basic PC benchmarks, the XPS 14 did as well as any thin laptop I've tested; and on graphics performance, it unsurprisingly handily beats machines with integrated graphics, even those with the latest Intel chips. It's not as fast as the larger workstation machines like the ThinkPad P1 or the HP Zbook Studio 16 I tested last fall, but those are far bigger, far heavier machines. The XPS should do a far better job at graphics-intensive tasks like photo and video editing than most similar-sized machines.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nOn my toughest tests, the XPS 14 completed a video transcode in Handbrake in an hour and 18 minutes, ran a MatLab portfolio simulation in just under 33 minutes, and completed a large Excel model in 46 minutes, all in line with other Meteor Lake-based machines I tested. (Note that for Excel, older Raptor Lake-based systems seem faster, probably because of their faster clock speeds).\n\nIt really shined on the AI benchmarks I tried. On UL's Procyon AI inference test, the scores were in line with the other Meteor Lake systems when running with Windows ML or OpenVino; testing it with the Nvidia Tensor RT software made a huge difference, scoring more than twice as fast. In testing with a local installation of Spatial Diffusion, it created graphics in 6 or 7 seconds, compared with 3 or 4 minutes on the Meteor Lake machines with discrete graphics. If you intend to be running local AI models, that's a huge improvement.\n\nOne downside is battery life. On PCMark 10's Modern Office test, the XPS 14, which has a 70-watt-hour battery, lasted 9 hours and 18 minutes at 40 nits, and 8 hours and 38 minutes at 100 nits, both 2.5 to 3 hours less than the Meteor Lake systems with discrete graphics. Still, that's not bad.\n\nThe XPS line is available with both OLED and more traditional LCD displays. My unit had a 3200-by-2000-pixel resolution OLED with up to 400 nits of brightness a default showing text at 250%; it looked terrific. It comes with a 1080p FHD webcam that I thought looked very sharp, with nice colors.\n\nDell supports the basic Windows Studio Effects through the Camera app, including automatic framing, eye contact, and background effects. Unlike the recent HP and Lenovo systems I tested, Dell does not offer its own video enhancement software. I was surprised not to see any webcam shutter, though a light next to the camera does let you know when it’s on.\n\nThe camera supports Windows Hello, and with presence detection, so you can set the machine to lock when you step away from it and unlock as you approach. This is enabled through the MyDell application, which also includes such things as color calibration, 3D audio features, and the ability to remove background noise in audio. It supports Dolby Atmos and Waves MaxxAudio for 3D sound, plus has four speakers (two main and two tweeters). I thought the audio quality was quite good.\n\nThe XPS 14 has a limited variety of ports. The left side has two Thunderbolt/USB-C ports, while the right has another one, a microSD slot, and an audio jack. It’s convenient to be able to charge the machine through the USB-C ports on either the left or right, and the unit came with a USB-C dongle that supports both USB-A and HDMI, but for now, I prefer having HDMI and USB-A built-in.\n\nAs I write this, a similar model to my configuration (with the top-end Meteor Lake processor, Nvidia graphics, 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage) lists at $2,699 while a version without discrete graphics, non-touch LCD display, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage starts at $1,699. If you want the extra performance, you'll pay for it.\n\nIn summary, there's a lot to like about the XPS 14, with its modern look, very nice webcam, and great performance. There are tradeoffs—a keyboard that won't appeal to everyone, no webcam shutter, and weaker battery life than machines with integrated graphics. But if you're looking for discrete graphics in a smaller machine, or want to run AI models locally, the XPS 14 offers much to like.\n\nHere's PCMag's review of the similarly equipped Dell XPS 16 (9640).",

The model I tested had a wonderful 14.5-inch touch OLED display that looked great. All that power comes at a price, and the keyboard will attract some users, while turning others off.\n\nMeasuring 12.6 x 8.5 x 0.71 inches, the XPS 14 (9440) is just barely larger than the X1 Carbon Gen 12 and a bit smaller than the HP x360 Spectre 14. It looks good in CNC aluminum and is available in either a lighter platinum or a darker graphite shade; I used the former, and it looked quite good. The 14.5-inch display has very small bezels and is on a hinge that drops down, so you don’t see as much of the bezel as on other machines, with the hinge leaving room for air vents on the bottom of the unit. In short, it looks very modern.\n\nProbably because of the included discrete graphics, it’s heavier than the other machines I mentioned – my model, which had an OLED display, weighs 3.87 pounds (4.59 pounds with the included 100-watt charger), about 1.5 pounds more than the X1 Carbon. But it’s still rather sleek, and the weight is light compared to most machines with this level of graphics.\n\nAs mentioned, the keyboard will be controversial. It has a seamless glass touchpad, with haptic feedback and a Gorilla Glass cover. You don’t see the outlines of the touchpad area, but it reaches from the Windows key to the backspace, a larger area than on almost any laptop I’ve seen. Instead of traditional function key buttons, it has a capacitive touch function row, in which lights show you the various functions. All the essential keys are there, but since they don't change, I'm not quite sure about the benefit this offers for users. I wish it had indicator lights showing you when the speakers are muted. But it does allow for more cooling, which is important because of the graphics.\n\nThe backlit keyboard itself is flatter than I’m used to, but the keys are large with little room between them, and with 0.3mm travel, it’s an improvement from similar keyboards I’ve seen in the past. This is one of the first laptops I've used that has a dedicated physical Microsoft Copilot key, and that worked fine. Overall, the keyboard took a little getting used to, but I could touch type on it without difficulty.\n\nThe version of the XPS 14 I tested is based on the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H (Meteor Lake), which Dell says is running at 30 watts in this configuration. The 7 155H includes six \"performance\" cores, each capable of running two threads, and eight \"efficient\" cores on the main CPU tile, along with two additional \"low-power efficient\" cores on a separate tile. The performance cores have a base frequency of 1.4GHz and a maximum turbo of 4.8GHz. For graphics, the Intel processor has Intel Arc Graphics, which means eight Xe graphics cores; it includes Intel’s AI Boost with an NPU. Of course, if you want great graphics, you’ll use the internal Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050, which comes with 6 GB of GDDR6 memory and can run at up to 30 watts. Combined, the system can use up to 47 watts, with the power distributed, depending on the application. The system I tested came with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.\n\nThe combination yields good to great performance, depending on the application. On basic PC benchmarks, the XPS 14 did as well as any thin laptop I've tested; and on graphics performance, it unsurprisingly handily beats machines with integrated graphics, even those with the latest Intel chips. It's not as fast as the larger workstation machines like the ThinkPad P1 or the HP Zbook Studio 16 I tested last fall, but those are far bigger, far heavier machines. The XPS should do a far better job at graphics-intensive tasks like photo and video editing than most similar-sized machines.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nOn my toughest tests, the XPS 14 completed a video transcode in Handbrake in an hour and 18 minutes, ran a MatLab portfolio simulation in just under 33 minutes, and completed a large Excel model in 46 minutes, all in line with other Meteor Lake-based machines I tested. (Note that for Excel, older Raptor Lake-based systems seem faster, probably because of their faster clock speeds).\n\nIt really shined on the AI benchmarks I tried. On UL's Procyon AI inference test, the scores were in line with the other Meteor Lake systems when running with Windows ML or OpenVino; testing it with the Nvidia Tensor RT software made a huge difference, scoring more than twice as fast. In testing with a local installation of Spatial Diffusion, it created graphics in 6 or 7 seconds, compared with 3 or 4 minutes on the Meteor Lake machines with discrete graphics. If you intend to be running local AI models, that's a huge improvement.\n\nOne downside is battery life. On PCMark 10's Modern Office test, the XPS 14, which has a 70-watt-hour battery, lasted 9 hours and 18 minutes at 40 nits, and 8 hours and 38 minutes at 100 nits, both 2.5 to 3 hours less than the Meteor Lake systems with discrete graphics. Still, that's not bad.\n\nThe XPS line is available with both OLED and more traditional LCD displays. My unit had a 3200-by-2000-pixel resolution OLED with up to 400 nits of brightness a default showing text at 250%; it looked terrific. It comes with a 1080p FHD webcam that I thought looked very sharp, with nice colors.\n\nDell supports the basic Windows Studio Effects through the Camera app, including automatic framing, eye contact, and background effects. Unlike the recent HP and Lenovo systems I tested, Dell does not offer its own video enhancement software. I was surprised not to see any webcam shutter, though a light next to the camera does let you know when it’s on.\n\nThe camera supports Windows Hello, and with presence detection, so you can set the machine to lock when you step away from it and unlock as you approach. This is enabled through the MyDell application, which also includes such things as color calibration, 3D audio features, and the ability to remove background noise in audio. It supports Dolby Atmos and Waves MaxxAudio for 3D sound, plus has four speakers (two main and two tweeters). I thought the audio quality was quite good.\n\nThe XPS 14 has a limited variety of ports. The left side has two Thunderbolt/USB-C ports, while the right has another one, a microSD slot, and an audio jack. It’s convenient to be able to charge the machine through the USB-C ports on either the left or right, and the unit came with a USB-C dongle that supports both USB-A and HDMI, but for now, I prefer having HDMI and USB-A built-in.\n\nAs I write this, a similar model to my configuration (with the top-end Meteor Lake processor, Nvidia graphics, 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage) lists at $2,699 while a version without discrete graphics, non-touch LCD display, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage starts at $1,699. If you want the extra performance, you'll pay for it.\n\nIn summary, there's a lot to like about the XPS 14, with its modern look, very nice webcam, and great performance. There are tradeoffs—a keyboard that won't appeal to everyone, no webcam shutter, and weaker battery life than machines with integrated graphics. But if you're looking for discrete graphics in a smaller machine, or want to run AI models locally, the XPS 14 offers much to like.\n\nHere's PCMag's review of the similarly equipped Dell XPS 16 (9640).",

        "text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works\n\nMicrosoft not only has a number of first-party games it plans to release for Xbox and PC platforms in 2024, it also has a couple of games it will publish from third-party developers via Xbox Games Studios. One of them is Towerborne, the fantasy-themed action-adventure game from developer Stoic Games.\n\nThis week, Stoic posted a new developer interview on the official Towerborne website that showcased the creation of one of the game's enemy monsters. It's called the Truffleclub, and despite its name and its surface appearance, it looks like it will be a pretty formidable foe to defeat.\n\nStoic's Lead Concept Artist, Jeff Murchie, stated in the interview that they wanted the Truffleclub to look like a creature that would come from a fungi-themed forest in the game. The creature was also supposed to be a smasher in terms of its combat style. He added:\n\nOne of the tricky aspects of character development (specifically enemies) in Towerborne is striking a balance for a creature that is both frightening and whimsical in appearance. We did not want designs that just feel scary and intimidating.\n\nThe interview includes concept artwork along with some video showing how Stoic evolved the look, movements, and attacks for the Truffleclub. They also posted a video on YouTube showing an early combat test for the creature. In addition to using its two big and spiked \"hands\" to smash player characters, it will also be able to tunnel underground and then reemerge above ground to try to outsmart the player. It will also be able to spit out what looks like acid drops at players.\n\nStoic still plans to release Towerborne sometime in 2024, again as an Xbox and PC exclusive and published by Microsoft. You can join its own Insider Program right now for a chance to play the game before it is officially released.",

        "text": "Dow Jones futures will open Sunday evening, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, following a tough market week. Earnings from Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META) and many more are on deck. Tesla, which reports Tuesday, slashed EV and FSD prices over the weekend.\n\nX\n\nThe stock market suffered sharp losses in the past week. The Dow Jones actually rose a fraction. But the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite plunged below their respective 50-day moving averages, suffering their worst week in more than a year.\n\nMost of all, leading stocks were the biggest losers. Nvidia (NVDA), the ultimate AI stock and company, dived below key support.\n\nChip and AI stocks sold off on cautious comments from ASML (ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM).\n\nAI server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) crashed Friday after not releasing preliminary results, raising fears about AI demand overall.\n\nThe market environment is decidedly weak. Investors should be largely in cash, waiting for renewed signs of strength in the major indexes and leading stocks.\n\nKey Earnings Ahead\n\nMicrosoft, Meta Platforms, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) headline a huge week of earnings. General Electric (GE), ServiceNow (NOW), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Dexcom (DXCM) and Caterpillar (CAT) are among the many other notable reports on tap.\n\nGoogle stock is in a buy zone. Meta stock, Chipotle and Caterpillar could be setting up, while Dexcom has retreated slightly below a buy point. GE is greatly extended while Microsoft and ServiceNow are starting to crack. Tesla stock has plunged to 52-week lows amid a host of bad news.\n\nThese reports and guidance will have a huge impact on their sectors and overall market. Microsoft, Google, Meta and ServiceNow will offer insights into artificial intelligence, as well as cloud computing, online advertising and business software.\n\nFor Tesla, there are huge questions regarding the EV giant's growth strategy. Most of all, is Elon Musk shelving a next-generation Model 2?\n\nOn Saturday, Tesla cut Model Y, S and X prices in the U.S. by $2,000, while also cutting Full Self-Driving to $8,000 from $12,000.\n\nOn Sunday, Tesla cut China prices for the Model 3 and Y by nearly $2,000 while slashing Model S and X prices by up to 22%. Tesla also cut Model 3 prices in key European markets by roughly $2,100-$3,200.\n\nMeta stock is on IBD Leaderboard. Microsoft stock is on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list. Meta, DexCom and Google stock are on the IBD 50. Meta Platforms, Google and ServiceNow stock are on the IBD Big Cap 20.\n\nDow Jones Futures Today\n\nDow Jones futures open at 6 p.m. ET, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures.\n\nRemember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.\n\nJoin IBD experts as they analyze leading stocks and the market on IBD Live\n\nStock Market Suffers Big Losses\n\nThe stock market suffered heavy losses this past week, especially the Nasdaq and leading growth plays.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.01% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index tumbled 3.05%, its biggest weekly decline since March 2023. The Nasdaq composite plunged 5.5%, its worst week since November 2022. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 2.8%.\n\nThe market's power trend, in force since November, is over as the Nasdaq's 21-day exponential moving average undercut the 50-day line.\n\nSome stocks are holding support, with a few making encouraging moves. But generally leading stocks are looking damaged or broken.\n\nAI and chip stocks had been holding up reasonably well. But they led the downside this past week, with Nvidia and especially Super Micro plunging on Friday.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility index, or VIX, briefly spiked Friday to the market fear gauge's highest levels since late October. Meanwhile, various indicators suggest the market is significantly oversold. But it's been oversold for some time.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield jumped 11 basis points to 4.61%, hitting a five-month intraday high of nearly 4.7% on Tuesday. Markets now expect just one Fed rate cut in 2024.\n\nU.S. crude oil futures fell 2.9% to $83.14 a barrel for the week.\n\nTesla Plunges With One Big Question For The Earnings Call\n\nETFs\n\nAmong growth ETFs, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) plunged 5.1%. Microsoft is a huge IGV holding, with ServiceNow stock a key component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) dived 9.7%. Nvidia stock is the No. 1 holding in SMH, with Taiwan Semi and ASML key members.\n\nSPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) dipped 0.8% last week. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) retreated 2.8%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) jumped 4.7%. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) skidded 3.9%.\n\nThe Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) fell 1.25% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) closed fractionally higher. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) gave up 2%, with Caterpillar and GE stock the top two holdings.\n\nThe Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) advanced 0.85% and the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) climbed 1.8%.\n\nReflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) sold off 9.6% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 10%. Tesla stock is a huge holding across Ark Invest's ETFs.\n\nTime The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nAI Hardware Stocks Plunge\n\nAI chip and hardware stocks, the driving force of the market rally from late October to early March, were the big losers last week.\n\nASML plunged 10.6% for the week on weak Q1 sales and guidance. That also dragged down other chip-equipment makers.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor stock dived 10.4% despite beating views and guiding higher, fueled by AI chip demand. But the foundry giant was cautious about demand for chips overall.\n\nNvidia tumbled 13.6%, including Friday's 10% dive to knife through the 50-day. It's now given up over two-thirds of its gains following the fiscal Q1 earnings on Feb. 21.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) crashed 31% for the week\n\nSMCI stock dived 20.6% for the week even with Tuesday's 10.6% spike. Shares dived 23.1% on Friday, literally on no news. Disappointing investors, Super Micro didn't give preliminary results as the AI server maker announced its upcoming Q1 earnings date. That might have also raised concerns about AI chip demand.\n\nAll of these stocks flashed sell signals.\n\nSMCI and Nvidia are the two biggest winners on the S&P 500 in 2024, but they were the S&P 500's biggest losers Friday.\n\nCatch The Next Big Winning Stock With MarketSurge\n\nWhat To Do Now\n\nThe stock market is in bad shape. The major indexes are all well below their 50-day moving averages. Nvidia and other tech standouts are no longer resisting the selling but instead starting to lead the slide.\n\nIt's not a time to be buying stocks. Investors should have slim-to-modest exposure, generally only keeping winners with a hefty cushion.\n\nThis is a time to build watchlists. You want to look for stocks finding support and showing relative strength.\n\nThere are some names holding up, including GE, Google, Meta, Chipotle, Glaukos (GKOS), Martin Marietta (MLM) and Allstate (ALL).\n\nRemember that in a downtrend, resilient stocks today may not stay that way tomorrow, as Nvidia, Super Micro and ServiceNow showed.\n\nAnd relative winners can be absolute losers.\n\nEarnings season could provide a positive catalyst for stocks. But, as investors saw this past week, they could trigger fresh selling.\n\nRead The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.\n\nPlease follow Ed Carson on Threads at @edcarson1971 and X/Twitter at @IBD_ECarson for stock market updates and more.\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:\n\nWhy This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks\n\nWant To Get Quick Profits And Avoid Big Losses?

        "title": "This artificially intelligent pin wants to free you from your phone",
        "text": "On a recent afternoon, I held a bagel in front of me and said: “Look and tell me if this is healthy.”\n\nA monotone voice responded that the bagel was unhealthy because it was high in carbohydrates, which could contribute to weight gain.\n\nI wasn’t talking to a tech bro obsessed with the ketogenic diet. This was the Ai Pin, a $700 tiny computer featuring a virtual assistant pulling data from OpenAI (the research firm behind the ChatGPT chatbot), Google, Microsoft and others to answer questions and perform tasks.\n\nShaped like a lapel pin that may be a throwback to “Star Trek,” it attaches to your clothing with magnets and is supposed to offload tasks you would normally do with a smartphone, like taking notes, searching the web and shooting photos. Instead of a screen, the pin shines a green laser on your hand to show text. The device includes a camera, speaker and cellular connection.\n\nThe novel design of the Ai Pin, which was made by the startup Humane, generated buzz when it was unveiled late last year. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, and companies including Microsoft and Salesforce have placed a bold bet — to the tune of $240 million in funding for Humane — that artificially intelligent hardware like the Ai Pin will become the next big thing after the smartphone. (The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft last year for using copyrighted news articles without permission to train chatbots.)\n\nHumane said its goal with the Ai Pin was to offer technology that would help people avoid screens and maintain eye contact.\n\nI liked the chic aesthetic and concept of the pin. It was occasionally helpful, like when it suggested items to pack for my recent trip to Hawaii. But as I wore it for two weeks, it presented glaring flaws. Often, its responses were off-putting, like with the bagel, or wrong, like when it said the square root of 49 was 49. Also, the Times’ photo shoot of the Ai Pin ended prematurely when the device overheated and shut down.\n\nI wouldn’t pay $700 for this pin — let alone the $24-a-month subscription required to use its data services, including its T-Mobile cellular plan. But consider my curiosity piqued.\n\nImran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, Humane’s husband-and-wife founders, who worked at Apple, said updates issued through its servers would address many of the glitches I had encountered, including heat issues and shoddy math.\n\n“It’s a journey, and we are just at the start,” Bongiorno said. “The first version is never the entirety of the vision.”\n\nHere’s how my experience wearing the Ai Pin went.\n\nGetting started\n\nSince the Ai Pin lacks a screen, users set up their accounts and other settings on Humane’s website. To unlock the device with a passcode, hold out your hand to project a green laser onto your palm. Pulling your hand outward increases the number while pulling it inward decreases it, and you select each digit by pinching two fingers on the same hand.\n\nThe laser can be used to tweak other settings, like connecting to a Wi-Fi network, and it can show a text transcription of the virtual assistant’s answers. Humane said the laser was intended to be used for no longer than nine minutes, but for me, it lasted about three before the Ai Pin complained it was too hot and shut down.\n\nA virtual assistant\n\nBeyond unlocking the pin with the laser, you’ll control the Ai Pin mostly with finger taps and your voice. The advantage of pinning a virtual assistant to my shirt became clear when I was moving around and thinking about the many things I had to do.\n\nWith one finger held down on the Ai Pin, I could summon the assistant and ask it to add tasks to my to-do list. This feature shined when I was packing for my vacation to Hawaii and adding items to my packing list, including T-shirts and swim trunks. When I asked the pin to suggest other items to pack for my trip there, it recommended a hat, sunscreen and other relevant items. Very cool.\n\nHowever, the Ai Pin was less helpful in some other situations. When I was in Hawaii last week, I struggled to remember the name of a food truck near my hotel serving loco moco, so I asked the assistant to look it up for me. It said no such food truck could be found, leading me to search on my phone instead.\n\nA language interpreter\n\nAn important feature on the Ai Pin is the ability to translate a conversation into another language in real time. With one finger held down on the pin, I could set a language to translate to, such as Mandarin. When I held two fingers down on the pin and spoke a phrase in English, the Ai Pin said it in Mandarin, and vice versa.\n\nI tested this with several other languages, including Spanish, French and Indonesian. I confirmed that the interpreter was usually correct, though with converting English into Mandarin, it incorrectly translated “good morning” into “da jia hao,” which means “hello, everyone.”\n\nWould you look at that?\n\nHumane is including a feature called Vision on the Ai Pin, which is labeled “beta” to signal that it is unfinished. The device uses its camera and AI to analyze your surroundings and give information about what you are looking at. This is what led to my quirky experience with a bagel, which only got weirder when I asked more questions.\n\nI asked the pin how to make the bagel more delicious, and it proceeded to explain how to make bagels from scratch. Eventually, I asked the pin to come up with suggestions for sandwiches that could be made with the bagel. It generated a long list of ideas, including chickpea salad sandwiches, sloppy Joes and cucumber sandwiches with green chutney.\n\nOn vacation, I visited a botanical garden and asked the pin to identify a flower. “The flower is yellow with red stripes on the inside,” the pin said. This was correct, but it didn’t answer my question.\n\n“It’s a Solandra maxima,” my wife said. She had taken a photo of the flower with her phone and uploaded it into a Google Images search. I felt sheepish.\n\nHumane said it was working constantly to improve the Vision feature.\n\nThe phone stuff\n\nSimilar to a smartphone, the Ai Pin has its own phone number and cellular data connection to place phone calls and play music, and its camera can be used to shoot photos and videos.\n\nHere is where the Ai Pin especially underdelivered. For something designed to make you spend less time on your phone, it isn’t better than a smartphone at any of those tasks. Photos and videos taken with the camera look poorly lit and blurry. To place a phone call, you can ask the assistant to call someone in your address book, but to dial a new number, you dictate the digits. For music, the device currently works only with Tidal, an unpopular music streaming service.\n\nBongiorno said the Ai Pin let her take more candid photos without a screen getting in the way. But to me, this was a disadvantage. Without a viewfinder, photos looked poorly framed.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhile the Ai Pin was occasionally useful and impressive, it was wrong, unhelpful or inefficient enough times to drive me back to my phone.\n\nGary Marcus, an AI entrepreneur, said the mistakes the Ai Pin made, like with the bagel, were the result of so-called hallucinations, the tendency for AI to guess and make things up when it can’t find the right answer. That’s a problem that remains unsolved in many AI technologies including ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.\n\nBongiorno acknowledged that hallucinations were happening with Gemini, the technology behind the Ai Pin’s Vision feature. She added that the technology would improve rapidly with user feedback and that the company had already finessed the pin’s reaction to bagels.\n\nMarcus said no company yet had AI technology that was sophisticated enough to make a virtual assistant answer questions reliably.\n\n“It’s almost like a broken watch being right twice a day,” he said. “It’s right some of the time, but you don’t know which part of the time, and that greatly diminishes its value.”\n\nYet there is a kernel of an idea worth preserving. I liked having an assistant on my shirt when it was actually helpful. I’ll pin my hopes on future iterations of the product — perhaps a cheaper one that lacks a camera and a laser.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\nGet more business news by signing up for our Economy Now newsletter.",

Integrating AI into your presentation workflow can streamline processes, enhance creativity, and captivate your audience. However, to maximize the potential of AI-powered presentations, it’s crucial to implement best practices that balance automation with personalization and ensure that your message remains authentic and tailored to your audience. Here are some strategic tips for creating compelling AI-powered presentations:\n\nBrand Alignment\n\nTo ensure your presentation reflects your brand identity, it’s essential to incorporate brand elements consistently. AI tools often provide options for customization, allowing you to use your brand’s color palette, logo, and fonts. Doing so creates a cohesive visual identity that immediately resonates with your audience. Additionally, while AI may suggest text, reviewing and adapting it to maintain your brand voice is crucial. This involves ensuring that the language used aligns with your brand’s tone and style, thus preserving the familiarity and trust your audience associates with your brand.\n\nTailoring AI Suggestions\n\nWhile AI-generated content can serve as a valuable starting point, it’s essential to curate rather than automate. Rather than blindly adopting AI suggestions, carefully review them to ensure they align with your presentation’s objectives and message. This may involve refining or restructuring the content to maintain a cohesive flow and relevance. It’s also crucial to remain mindful of tangents or deviations that AI-generated suggestions may introduce, ensuring that your presentation stays focused and on track.\n\nBlending AI and Personalization\n\nInfusing your presentation with personal insights and experiences is essential to enhancing its impact. While AI excels at data analysis, it lacks the human touch that personal anecdotes and industry expertise can provide. Supplementing AI-generated content with your unique perspective adds depth, credibility, and emotional resonance to your presentation. Moreover, using AI to analyze audience demographics or past presentation data lets you personalize your content further, incorporating relevant statistics and examples that resonate with your audience segments.\n\nLooking Ahead: The Future of AI in Presentations\n\nAI technology has significantly transformed how presentations are created and delivered. Current capabilities of AI presentation tools represent just the tip of the iceberg, with immense potential for further evolution. Natural Language Processing (NLP), in particular, has been a game-changer, enabling AI to understand and generate human-like text.\n\nAdvanced Natural Language Processing\n\nOne of the most promising areas for AI in presentation creation lies in advanced natural language processing capabilities. Imagine feeding key points and arguments into an AI tool, generating a compelling narrative with smooth transitions and impactful language. This would urge presenters to avoid the dull tasks of scriptwriting, allowing them to focus on refining their message and delivery. Furthermore, voice-activated slide building could further streamline the process by allowing presenters to speak their ideas directly into the AI tool, translating them into visually appealing slides with relevant content.\n\nAnother exciting prospect is the ability of AI to personalize content for different audience demographics. By analyzing audience characteristics, such as industry background or level of expertise, the AI could tailor the presentation content accordingly. For instance, it could use technical jargon for industry peers while simplifying language for a general audience, ensuring maximum engagement and comprehension.\n\nThe Future of AI in Presentation Engagement and Analysis\n\nAI holds immense potential for enhancing audience engagement and providing valuable insights for presenters post-presentation. Real-time audience engagement analysis could revolutionize how presenters gauge audience reactions during presentations. For instance, sentiment analysis algorithms could analyze facial expressions and body language to determine audience engagement levels and comprehension. This real-time feedback allows presenters to adapt their delivery or content on the fly to maximize impact.\n\nMoreover, AI can support interactive Q&A sessions by analyzing audience questions and suggesting relevant real-time follow-up information or data points. This capability enables presenters to address questions comprehensively and keep the audience engaged throughout the session. Furthermore, personalized post-presentation insights provided by AI could offer invaluable feedback for future presentations. By analyzing audience engagement levels at different points, the AI can help presenters tailor their content and delivery for maximum impact, ensuring that each presentation leaves a lasting impression on the audience.\n\nConclusion\n\nAI can churn out visually stunning slides in a flash, saving you hours wrestling with design software. But AI’s impact goes beyond efficiency. It can spark creativity by suggesting innovative layouts, generating data visualizations that bring your message to life, and even helping you write clear and concise content.\n\nReady to experience the power of AI for yourself? Dive into the world of AI presentation tools and PowerPoint alternatives. Discover how they can elevate your next presentation, and don’t forget to share your experiences.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nBefore we conclude, let’s address some commonly asked questions about creating presentations for AI.

        "text": "Artificial intelligence has shaken up the investing landscape since the groundbreaking launch of ChatGPT in November 2022.\n\nSince then, investors have poured money into all things related to AI as they hunt for the next big winners. In 2023, a group of major technology players dubbed the Magnificent Seven — Tesla , Amazon , Meta Platforms , Apple , Microsoft , Alphabet and Nvidia — contributed to a large chunk of the market's rally.\n\nThose tail winds continued into 2024, but even the winners eventually reach their limit. Indeed, some of this year's highest fliers came down to earth on Friday, with Big Tech names dragging down the Nasdaq Composite by more than 2%.\n\n\"You have to do your work,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \"You want to do the research, you want to know what you're buying, you want to know the risks involved. In AI right now, there are a lot of unknowns.\"\n\nAI is poised to be a central theme as the technology transitions from early-stage winners to second-stage adopters. Portfolio and wealth managers say investors may want to undertake certain strategies if they're looking for long-term plays in the space.\n\nWhat to look for\n\nThere's no secret formula to investing and picking artificial intelligence stocks, but investors can keep an eye on certain metrics and trends when weeding out the winners from the duds.\n\nWhen investing in any new industry, Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, recommends that investors keep an eye on companies' cash burn and how they are spending their money. Be attentive to the fine details, including how a company works through a backlog and how much money it devotes toward infrastructure.\n\nWhen it comes to chip stocks, Schleif also recommends taking a look at government grants. The industry won big in 2022 when President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law. The measure allocated funds toward building out semiconductor production on U.S. soil.\n\nSamsung Electronics is in line to receive funding from CHIPS for making semiconductors in Texas, while Intel has been awarded up to $8.5 billion from the measure.\n\n\"Focus on the underlying fundamentals, and are they moving in the right direction, [rather] than just last quarter's earnings,\" Schleif advised.\n\nInvestors should also avoid blindly chasing the hot winners that have benefited from AI enthusiasm. For Laffer Tengler Investments CEO and CIO Nancy Tengler, that means looking at some of the old-economy stocks embracing the new digital wave. She likes Microsoft and IBM , a pair of tech industry veterans.\n\nWhen building any portfolio, financial advisors and portfolio managers stress the importance of diversification — and the same applies to AI.\n\nAn exchange-traded fund might be a good way to get that diversified exposure to a basket of stocks that could benefit from the AI theme, rather than sticking with one or two promising names.\n\nConsider diversifying through ETFs\n\nSelecting ETFs that incorporate dozens of names can be a lower-risk way to diversify, said Marguerita Cheng, a certified financial planner and CEO of Blue Ocean Global Wealth in Gaithersburg, Maryland.\n\nShe highlighted the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) , the First Trust Nasdaq AI and Robotics ETF (ROBT) and the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ).\n\n\"That's one way to get some exposure without putting the proverbial all the eggs in that one basket,\" said BMO's Schleif. \"You want to be able to focus on a few different avenues such that you can withstand the volatility.\"",

By simply tagging a specific page with @, users can prompt Copilot to analyze that page directly, resulting in quicker and more accurate responses to queries. This feature enhances efficiency by eliminating the need for Copilot to sift through various sources, providing a more streamlined interaction experience for users.In addition to the tagging feature, Microsoft Edge introduces an enhanced Ask Copilot menu. This menu offers four options: Explain, Summarize, Expand, and Ask anything in Chat. These options empower users to interact with Copilot more effectively by specifying the type of assistance they require.

        "text": "In this tutorial, we will explain how to use ChatGPT API in Python, along with examples.\n\nSteps to Access ChatGPT API\n\nPlease follow the steps below to access the ChatGPT API.\n\nVisit the OpenAI Platform and sign up using your Google, Microsoft or Apple account. After creating your account, the next step is to generate a secret API key to access the API. The API key looks like this - sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx If your phone number has not been associated with any other OpenAI account previously, you may get free credits to test the API. Otherwise you have to add atleast 5 dollars into your account and charges will be based on the usage and the type of model you use. Check out the pricing details in the OpenAI website. Now you can call the API using the code below.\n\nPython Code to Access ChatGPT API\n\nStep 1 : To install the OpenAI Python library, run this command : pip install openai\n\nStep 2 : Enter your API key in os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = and input the question you would like to ask in the prompt argument in the code below.\n\nimport os import openai # Set API Key os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" openai.api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") def chatGPT(prompt, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature = 0.7, top_p=1): error_message = \"\" try: response = openai.ChatCompletion.create( model = model, messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}], temperature = temperature, top_p = top_p ) except Exception as e: error_message = str(e) if error_message: return \"An error occurred: {}\".format(error_message) else: return response['choices'][0]['message']['content'] # Run Function print(chatGPT(\"efficient way to remove duplicates in python. Less verbose response.\"))\n\nIn the model argument, you can enter either gpt-3.5-turbo , gpt-4-turbo or gpt-4 , pointing to their respective latest model version.\n\nCustom Instructions for ChatGPT\n\nSometimes you want ChatGPT to consider some high-level instructions while providing responses. In simple words, what do you want ChatGPT to know about you to provide responses. For example, you want the model to \"act like a linguistic expert and provide responses in layman's terms\". You can input instructions in the system_instruction argument in the code below.\n\n# System Message def chatGPT(prompt, system_instruction=None, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature = 0.7, top_p=1): error_message = \"\" try: messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}] if system_instruction: messages.insert(0, {'role': 'system', 'content': system_instruction}) response = openai.ChatCompletion.create( model = model, messages = messages, temperature = temperature, top_p = top_p ) except Exception as e: error_message = str(e) if error_message: return \"An error occurred: {}\".format(error_message) else: return response['choices'][0]['message']['content'] # Run Function print(chatGPT(prompt = \"who are you and what do you do?\", system_instruction = \"You are Janie Jones, the CEO of Jones Auto.\"))\n\nHow to Converse Like ChatGPT Website\n\nThe ChatGPT website remembers prior conversations while providing responses of the current question. For example : You ask '2+2', it answers '4'. Then you ask follow-up questions like \"square of it\", it returns '16'. So it remembers the prior response of '2+2'.\n\nBy default, the ChatGPT API does not remember prior conversations. However, we can make the ChatGPT API remember prior conversations by feeding it the previous questions and responses in each API request.\n\n# ChatGPT Chat import os import openai os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = \"sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" openai.api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") chatHistory = [] def chatGPT_chat(prompt, modelName=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature=0.7, top_p=1): params = { \"model\": modelName, \"temperature\": temperature, \"top_p\": top_p } chatHistory.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}) response = openai.ChatCompletion.create( **params, messages=chatHistory ) answer = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"].strip() chatHistory.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": answer}) return answer chatGPT_chat(\"2*3\") # 6 chatGPT_chat(\"square of it\") # The square of 6 is 36. chatGPT_chat(\"add 3 to it\") # Adding 3 to 36, we get 39.\n\nHow to Build Chatbot using ChatGPT API\n\nIn the following code, we are building an application using tkinter python library that creates a graphical user interface (GUI). It includes several widgets such as text boxes, buttons, dropdowns etc.\n\nTo install the tkinter library, run this command : pip install tkinter .\n\nimport os import openai import tkinter as tk # Set API Key os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" openai.api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") def chatGPT(prompt, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature = 0.7, top_p=1): error_message = \"\" try: response = openai.ChatCompletion.create( model = model, messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}], temperature = temperature, top_p = top_p ) except Exception as e: error_message = str(e) if error_message: return \"An error occurred: {}\".format(error_message) else: return response['choices'][0]['message']['content'] # tikinter GUI Application def chatgpt_output(): input_text = input_field.get() model_name = dropdown_var.get() response = chatGPT(input_text, model_name) output_field.config(state='normal') output_field.delete(1.0, tk.END) output_field.insert(tk.END, response) output_field.config(state='disabled') # Define the function to get the selected option def on_select(value): print(\"Selected model:\", value) # Create the main window root = tk.Tk() root.title(\"ChatGPT\") root.geometry(\"600x700\") options = [\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", \"gpt-4\", \"gpt-4-turbo\"] # Create a label label = tk.Label(root, text=\"Select Model:\", font=(\"Arial\", 12, \"italic\")) label.pack() # Create dropdown menu dropdown_var = tk.StringVar(root) dropdown_var.set(options[0]) dropdown_font = ('Arial', 12) dropdown = tk.OptionMenu(root, dropdown_var, *options, command=on_select) dropdown.config(font=dropdown_font) dropdown.pack() # Create a label for the input field input_label = tk.Label(root, text=\"Enter Your Prompt:\", font=(\"Arial\", 14, \"italic\")) input_label.pack(pady=5) # Create input field input_field = tk.Entry(root, font=(\"Arial\", 14), width=50, bd=2, relief=\"groove\", justify=\"left\") input_field.pack(pady=5, ipady=15) # Create submit button submit_button = tk.Button(root, text=\"Submit\", font=(\"Arial\", 14), command=chatgpt_output) submit_button.pack(pady=10) # Create output box output_field = tk.Text(root, font=(\"Arial\", 14), state='disabled') output_field.pack(pady=10) # Start root.mainloop()\n\nHow to Improve Chatbot's look?\n\nThe GUI developed using the tkinter library lacks fancy visuals. To build a more modern and stylish interface, use the Gradio package and refer to this article for the same - Building ChatGPT Clone in Python Using Gradio\n\nSpread the Word!\n\nShare",

        "text": "Gold-bug Peter Schiff fully admits he would ‘be a lot richer’ had he invested all his money in the ‘Magnificent 7’ a decade ago\n\nGold-bug Peter Schiff has admitted he could have made a lot more money over the last decade if he had focused his investing on high-performing stocks instead of gold.\n\n“Had I had all my money 10 years ago in the ‘Magnificent Seven,’ I’d be a lot richer than I am today,” the 61-year-old investor said recently on the PBD Podcast.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger\n\nCost-of-living in America is still out of control — use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says\n\nThese 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\n“I mean, I’m rich enough, but I would have more money had I concentrated on those names,” Schiff added — referring to the seven giants dominating the U.S. stock market: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA) and Meta (META).\n\nHere’s why U.S. stock investors saw their wealth explode in the last decade — and why Schiff still cautions against being overweight equities.\n\nTop 1% rake in huge gains\n\nThe total net worth of the wealthiest 1% in the U.S. hit $44.6 trillion at the end of 2023, according to Federal Reserve data — a new record driven primarily by an end-of-year stock rally that boosted rich individuals’ investment portfolios.\n\nThat new wealth record marks an almost 50% jump from the first quarter of 2020, when the total net worth of the top 1% was $30.1 trillion.\n\nRead more: 'Baby boomers bust': Robert Kiyosaki warns that older Americans will get crushed in the 'biggest bubble in history' — 3 shockproof assets for instant insurance now\n\nSchiff, who said in June 2023 that his “net worth is a lot more than $80 million,” would fit within the Fed’s top 1% definition for Q4 2023 — but unlike some of his wealthy peers, the growth in his net worth was somewhat restricted by his investing philosophy, which is hyper-focused on gold.\n\nWhen quizzed by Patrick Bet-David, host of the PBD Podcast, about how much his net worth has increased over the past decade, Schiff said: “It’s hard to say. My investment portfolio has gone up. In fact, the non-gold portion over that time frame has done better.

        "text": "The world today is a geopolitical hot mess. One source of that messiness is a lack of consensus among scholars and policymakers about the global distribution of power. Do we still live in a world of U.S. hegemony? Is it a bipolar or multipolar world? Or are states no longer the globe’s key actors, and do we instead live in an age of “ technopolarity ,” where corporate titans such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and billionaire Elon Musk are the new great powers?\n\nThe world today is a geopolitical hot mess. One source of that messiness is a lack of consensus among scholars and policymakers about the global distribution of power. Do we still live in a world of U.S. hegemony? Is it a bipolar or multipolar world? Or are states no longer the globe’s key actors, and do we instead live in an age of “technopolarity,” where corporate titans such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and billionaire Elon Musk are the new great powers?\n\nThe academic cacophony is disturbing. Uncertainty about the distribution of power is not merely a matter of debate; when actors disagree about the distribution of power, wars can start.\n\nThe book covers of Underground Empire and Digital Empires by Henrey Farrell and Abraham Newman and Anu Bradford.\n\nTwo books published last year offer divergent takes on these questions. In Underground Empire: How America Weaponized the World Economy, Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman posit that the United States still wields a considerable amount of structural power in the global system. Anu Bradford’s Digital Empires: The Global Battle to Regulate Technology, however, argues that the surprising superpower is neither the United States nor China but the European Union.\n\nBoth books examine the exercise of power and governance in the digital sphere. Their contrasting evaluations help explain why it is so difficult for even the sharpest observers of global affairs to agree about the current state of the world—particularly when technology is involved.\n\nFarrell and Newman’s Underground Empire builds on the pair’s pathbreaking 2019 article in International Security, “Weaponized Interdependence: How Global Economic Networks Shape State Coercion.” In that paper, Farrell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, and Newman, a professor at Georgetown University, posited that, across many economic sectors, globalization generated a network structure that concentrated power in a few central nodes. States that controlled those nodes—such as the United States—could exercise considerable global influence.\n\nUnderground Empire reminds readers of the article’s core argument. In their introduction, the authors write, “The global economy relied on a preconstructed system of tunnels and conduits that the United States could move into and adapt, nearly as easily as if they had been custom-designed by a military engineer for that purpose. By seizing control of key intersections, the U.S. government could secretly listen to what adversaries were saying to each other or freeze them out of the global financial system.”\n\nUnderground Empire expands far beyond this point, however. There is an interesting discussion, for one, of how the private sector helped create this centralized world and the conditions under which multinational corporations have been willing extensions of federal power: “Entrepreneur after entrepreneur discovered that the best way to turn a profit in a decentralized economy was to figure out ways to centralize parts of it again.”\n\nBradford’s Digital Empires similarly builds on earlier work. Bradford draws from her 2020 book, The Brussels Effect, which argues that the EU’s combination of market power and technocratic capacity made it a superpower in issue areas where Europeans preferred stringent regulatory standards. In Digital Empires, Bradford, a professor at Columbia Law School, contends that there are three great powers when it comes to online technology—and each of them offers a different variety of digital capitalism. As she describes it, “the US has pioneered a largely market-driven model, China a state-driven model, and the EU a rights-driven model.”\n\nThese varying approaches lead to horizontal clashes between the United States, China, and the EU on regulatory and technological issues such as data privacy and content moderation. Divergent digital preferences also create vertical clashes between these governments and the tech companies supplying digital infrastructure and services. The Chinese state cowed its firms into greater compliance with government dictates; U.S. firms have been more willing to fight the federal government on questions of data privacy.\n\nA woman with short hair wearing a white top is seen through blurred light circles as she gestures with both hands.\n\nBoth Underground Empire and Digital Empires are analytically sharp and worth reading. Farrell and Newman pepper their narrative with entertaining anecdotes—such as the fact that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) labeled the internet’s international choke points after ski resorts. Bradford’s book is encyclopedic in its range; her discussion of global online policy disputes on issues including antitrust and artificial intelligence is comprehensive and useful for anyone wishing to read up on the subject matter.\n\nComparing and contrasting the authors’ arguments—as I am about to do—elides where they are in agreement. Both Underground Empire and Digital Empires stress the importance of institutional capacity as a means that states use to exercise power; some of Bradford’s arguments resemble those that Farrell and Newman made in their 2019 book, Of Privacy and Power. The new books also suggest that the concept of technopolarity does not have legs. After reading both books, one is likely to conclude that state power will be able to pressure the private sector into compliance on core national interests.\n\nNonetheless, what makes these books such interesting reading is where they diverge: the sources of state power in cyberspace.\n\nFor Farrell and Newman, Washington retains considerable structural power because so much of the digital world originated in the United States. This network centrality endows the United States with the ability to surveil, influence, and—if necessary—coerce other actors across multiple realms.\n\nAt least some of this was by design: The authors write that, during the early days of the internet, “[a]ccording to a former NSA employee, the U.S. government ‘quietly encourage[d] the telecommunications industry to increase the amount of international traffic that is routed through American-based switches’ to make it easier to spy on the world.” With China-U.S. tech competition heating up, Washington has employed unconventional measures to pressure China. These include the foreign direct product rule, which allows the United States to ban the export of products from other countries if those products rely on U.S.-made components or technology.\n\nOverall, Underground Empire suggests that some forms of structural power are extremely difficult to dislodge. As during the late 1980s—when many international relations scholars believed the United States was in terminal decline, only for the country to be the last superpower standing a decade later—commentators may be underestimating current U.S. power in the digital world.\n\nFor Bradford, however, what matters is the combination of market power, state capacity, and attractiveness of a government’s regulatory preferences. This formula enables her to predict that, going forward, the EU will be the most important democratic actor in global digital governance. The EU’s lack of big tech firms is a plus in Bradford’s model because it reduces the EU’s incentive to cater to domestic interest groups.\n\nAccording to Digital Empires, the laissez-faire market-based U.S. model of tech governance is losing its appeal both at home and abroad. Domestically, both major political parties have soured on Big Tech, albeit for different reasons. Democrats distrust the corporate concentration of Big Tech, while Republicans are convinced that content moderation has an anti-conservative bias. Globally, concerns about data privacy have made life more difficult for the Big Five tech firms—Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\nAs the U.S. model loses its luster, Bradford posits that the United States will align more closely with the EU against China’s more authoritarian model of digital governance. For Bradford, therefore, what matters is not control over critical nodes but control over critical markets.\n\nThe definitions of digital power proffered in Underground Empire and Digital Empires are not mutually exclusive. It can be simultaneously true that the United States retains considerable structural power and the EU exercises its market power adroitly—and all the while China tries to amass both forms of power. Still, if there are arenas of contestation where U.S., European, and Chinese officials disagree, whose form of power might prevail?\n\nHere, one would have to give a slight edge to Farrell and Newman and their argument in favor of U.S. structural power. Bradford’s case for the EU is weakened by a few empirical and theoretical claims that do not hold up. Her chapter on the “waning global influence of American techno-libertarianism” is normatively persuasive about the downsides of the U.S. model. Her claim that other democracies have turned against the U.S. model, however, relies almost entirely on criticisms levied by those countries after the 2013 Edward Snowden revelations rather than meaningful policy change.\n\nPhotographers swarm around a man wearing a suit with his back to the camera as he stands in front of a table to testify before members of the Senate Judiciary, seen in the distance.\n\nThere are two other areas where Bradford’s predictions are even more untenable. She suggests in her conclusion that “tech companies were reluctant to moderate content on their platforms but now increasingly concede they have a responsibility to do so more proactively.” This claim has not aged well. After Musk stripped Twitter’s content moderation team in 2022, other big tech firms followed suit. As the Washington Post reported last August, “[s]ocial media companies are receding from their role as watchdogs against political misinformation, abandoning their most aggressive efforts to police online falsehoods.” There is no sign of this trend abating during this record-breaking global year of elections.\n\nBradford also claims that the United States is moving toward the EU on AI regulations. “Artificial intelligence may well be the next frontier of the Brussels Effect,” she writes, adding that the EU’s AI regulation “may also serve as a template for other jurisdictions.” But a recent Politico story about the clash of EU and U.S. AI standards suggested a different outcome. EU member states such as France do not necessarily agree with Brussels. U.S. officials, along with Silicon Valley representatives, have also pushed back hard on EU standards. The result? “Heading into 2024, those who want a lighter touch appear to be winning, despite EU’s new binding rules on AI,” the Politico authors wrote.\n\nThe sources of power in cyberspace undoubtedly reside somewhere between Underground Empire and Digital Empires. It is possible, however, that they may also shift over time. Farrell and Newman’s argument holds considerable power for newer technologies as they emerge; what Underground Empire reveals is that geography matters even in cyberspace, particularly when the contours of any technological network remain somewhat obscured.\n\nAs time passes and technologies become more standardized, however, governments can also move down the learning curve. At these junctures, Bradford’s arguments about market power start to gain greater validity. This explains how both China and the EU remain great powers in a digital world.\n\nIn the end, what Underground Empire and Digital Empires suggest is that technology can help international relations theorists better understand the power debates that have haunted them since the days of Sparta and Athens.",

The penalty for failing to comply is 6% of their annual global revenue\n\nOn Friday, the EU Commission imposed new obligations on popular porn platforms like Pornhub, Stripchat, and XVideos under the Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\nIn an official statement, the Commission said “These specific obligations include submitting risk assessment reports to the Commission, putting in place mitigation measures to address systemic risks linked to the provision of their services.”\n\nAs per the definition given by the DSA, systematic risk includes: Illegal content\n\nIllegal content Content that threatens public health\n\nContent that threatens public health Compromises physical and mental well-being\n\nCompromises physical and mental well-being Encourages gender-based violence\n\nEncourages gender-based violence Threatens public security and electoral processes\n\nThreatens public security and electoral processes Compromises fundamental rights\n\nOn top of this, all three companies will have to maintain full transparency in matters related to advertisement and also give free data access to researchers.\n\nThe deadline to comply with these new directions has been set on April 21 for Pornhub and Stripchat and April 23 for XVideos.\n\nIf they fail to comply with the rules within the stipulated time period, a risk of up to 6% of their global turnover will be imposed on them.\n\nWhy Only These Websites?\n\nThere are plenty of adult content sites online so you might wonder why only these three were targeted. Well, the reason is that these 3 platforms are classified as ‘very large online companies’\n\nUnder the DSA, websites that receive more than 45 million users per month in the EU will be recognized as very large organizations (gatekeepers) and will face stricter rules.\n\nFor example, these sites will need to:\n\nMaintain a public database of all their ads\n\nMaintain a of all their ads Get independent audits at least once a year,\n\nGet at least once a year, Share their data with the Commission and other national agencies for monitoring purposes, and so on.\n\nShare their data with the Commission and other national agencies for monitoring purposes, and so on. Update their numbers (i,e, the total number of monthly users they get) every 6 months.\n\nIn case they have less than 45 million monthly users for the entire year, they will be removed from the list.\n\nThe reason for such stricter rules is pretty simple. The bigger a company is, the larger its user base and the influence it has on the public. Such power cannot be left unregulated.\n\nThe EU has earlier named six tech companies as ‘gatekeepers’ – Amazon, Google, Meta, Byte Dance, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\nA Little about the Digital Service Act\n\nThe DSA was first introduced in November 2022 and finally came into effect on August 25, 2023. It aims to create a safe and trustworthy online ecosystem in the EU.\n\nIt’s a user-centric directive that will ensure customer complaints are taken seriously, they have a pleasant online experience and the companies are transparent with their users.\n\nThere has been some resistance to the new rules. For example, companies like Amazon and Zalando claim that they have been wrongfully classified as very large online platforms, but the Commission is standing firm on its decisions so far. Even TikTok had challenged its status as a gatekeeper under the act.\n\nSo far, there have been no instances of any serious breach. However, with the EU clamping its hold on the Act, this can change very soon and we might see heavy penalties being imposed.",

        "text": "The past year there's been an independent open-source driver developer working on \"Terakan\" as a Vulkan driver for old Radeon HD 6000 series GPUs . These pre-GCN GPUs never received any official Vulkan driver support from AMD but thanks to open-source and a strong desire to pull off such a feat, Vitaliy Kuzmin \"Triang3l\" has been pursuing this challenge and has been pulling off some basic results . The work so far has been predominantly been carried out with the open-source Linux graphics stack while this weekend the Terakan driver was demonstrated under Microsoft Windows.Vitaliy Kuzmin has been spending much time working to get Radeon HD 6000 series / TeraScale GPUs working on Vulkan and leveraging the Mesa codebase. To much surprise, in his latest status update this Saturday he shows his Vulkan driver in action under Microsoft Windows on an old Radeon HD 6800 series (Barts) GPU:\n\nHe posted to X that he's successfully running some Vulkan demos on his independently-developed Terakan driver using a Radeon HD 6800 series GPU.It's a fun technical achievement and engineering milestone but ultimately of limited real-world use. These AMD Radeon graphics cards were introduced 13 years ago, simply having a Vulkan driver will not magically allow these vintage GPUs to work well for modern games/workloads, and applicable software sporting multiple API/renderer support will likely see better performance from the well-tuned OpenGL (or DirectX on Windows) drivers.AMD no longer maintains Windows driver support for the Radeon HD 6000 series and hasn't since 2016 with Windows 10 for their Radeon Software Crimson Edition Beta, so the rest of the AMD driver stack on Windows for these old GPUs is getting rather brittle. At least Terakan on Linux allows users to be running the very latest upstream kernel, Mesa driver support still maintained, etc, rather than resorting to an eight year old driver stack underneath Terakan.In any event it's fascinating to see what can be achieved by one individual pursuing open-source drivers and pulling off something never officially carried out by AMD for allowing Vulkan on TeraScale era graphics processors.",

        "text": "holy fucking shit!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI've had this in my drafts to finish writing up for a few weeks but today I made another discovery that has pushed me to finally write it up lol.\n\nMy PC had a few hiccups over the past couple of years. Nothing so serious that I was truly concerned (at first) but, annoyances, to be sure. (\"PC? Weren't you talking about a TV??\" you might be thinking to yourself. Yes. I'll get there. Oh, will I ever get there.)\n\nFor a long time, the most serious hiccup with my PC was being unable to open Display Settings on my PC. I had to use Nvidia control panel to make adjustments. Whatever. Didn't affect my ability to work or anything. I had just updated to Windows 11 so I thought maybe something went wrong in the update. So I did another install (which meant I had to re-install a ton of music plugin stuff on my computer which takes ages given all the stuff I use.)\n\nThe fresh install still didn't fix it. So I simply ignored it for the better part of 2 years.\n\nOver time, so slowly I didn't really clock them as being related, other things started to fail.\n\nI have a Komplete Kontrol S88 midi Keyboard that interfaces with Kontakt and Komplete Kontrol in my DAW. I can use the keyboard to adjust settings or select instruments without having to look at my computer screen. At some point last year this stopped working. I could still use it to input midi, and I was afraid I'd have to do a fresh install of all the Native Instruments stuff I use, so I kept putting off trying to fix it until I had less going on with work. It worked, just not as well as it should!\n\nThen, Task manager started to hang in weird ways. It wouldn't close unless I forced it closed with ProcExp. Whatever! Computers are weird!\n\nI had trouble getting video capture cards to connect when I considered streaming Splatoon. Whatever! I'm not a streamer, I should probably use that energy on something else.\n\nBut then, in March, I had some things fail that, turns out, are pretty necessary to using the computer.\n\nI was trying to get remote desktop to work on my tablet so I could work in the living room closer to my cat, Grendel, who was still very much in mourning for his best friend (<3 Guts). Grendel is at his happiest when he's napping on the couch next to a human. So I thought, hey, I could do some stuff in remote desktop mode! It wasn't something I used very often because it doesn't play super nice with audio, it'd been probably over a year since I last used it, but I knew it had worked and had been easy to set up.\n\nWell. It refused to connect despite appearing as an option on my tablet. And as I was trying to troubleshoot this problem...\n\nMy task bars on my PC disappeared! If I moused over the spot they should have been I got the loading circle. And my monitors would jitter!\n\nSystem settings were nowhere to be found. To navigate I had to open Task Manager (which if you recall was already acting strange and sluggish for the past year) in order to open the command panel, which I'd then use to launch programs. Or, attempt to. If I tried to open the system settings, my PC spat out \"Uhhh what's \"Settings\"? We ain't got settings\" (in command I got \"C:\\Windows\\System32>start ms-settings: Access is denied.\" despite being in admin mode )\n\nSO I started to panic a wee bit. It's not a great time for me to possibly need a new PC! Plus, it works great when it works .\n\nI manually backed up everything important from my main PC drive (as I could not access the windows backup program because it lived in settings!!!!!!!!) and downloaded the Windows 11 installer to a drive in case I needed to completely wipe my computer and start fresh.\n\nIn a last ditch effort, I tried updating my Nvidia GeForce graphics driver and restarted.\n\nLo and behold, my taskbars came back and I could access settings again! Huzzah!\n\nThis lasted for 6 days. And then the taskbars disappeared AGAIN along with Settings.\n\nAt least by now I'd become somewhat comfortable using command to get around, so I was less panicked than I was in round 1. I at least knew the computer wouldn't crash and delete all my shit suddenly (plus I had my backups that were up-to-date).\n\nI asked my friends if they'd ever heard of anything like this, and Cohost's own @ vogon helped me poke around some additional graphics driver stuff in case updating to the new Nvidia program that's in beta would solve my issue. This felt super promising when I went into safe mode and saw taskbars. So, I did the update, and, as before, when I updated, the taskbars came back! But there were gone again almost immediately. My screen literally started flickering and they vanished. It was so fucking bizarre.\n\nI turned to google once more, hoping that somehow, as useless as google is these days, maybe I'd find what I needed to fix my damn computer!\n\nSomehow, against all odds, I found it. I happened to use the exact right string in my search to pull up some reddit threads. The first one didn't have anything useful, but a few results down I spotted \"no taskbar and task manager freezes\" holy moly!!!\n\nAt first glance however, there wasn't anything useful. But then I spotted some collapsed comments at the bottom of the thread. I knew more than likely they just had comments like \"sucks bro\" or \"this is why i use linux :/\" But I expanded them and inside was a link to a Microsoft forum post. I kept my expectations in check and clicked on the link. What I saw had my nearly vibrating in my seat.\n\nThis was the solution.\n\nNarayan B\n\nNov 16, 2023, 12:20 AM\n\nSo I finally solved it!\n\nSource of the problem: an Android TV (HiSense model) connected to my network. Yes. A TV caused this issue.\n\nHISENSE? LIKE THE SAME BRAND OF TV I HAVE HAD SINCE 2020???\n\nI followed the instructions. I deleted keys generated by our TV for 5 straight minutes. 5 Minutes of like 200BPM clicking. I restarted. Everything worked again. I laughed so hard I cried. I felt like I'd solved a murder. The main suspect was the PC but the culprit was the TV in the other room. And he almost got away with it!!! If I had spent a few days carrying out a clean install and re-installing all my work stuff, my problem would have come back. If I had taken the PC out back and shot it and replaced it with a fancy new computer, the problem would have come back.\n\nBecause the problem was never the PC. The Problem was my Hisense TV in the next room.\n\nOnce I carried this out, I was able to open display settings for the first time (outside of safe mode) in 2 years. When I deleted the keys, my Task Manager started behaving normally again. I turned around and saw that my keyboard was once again displaying the VST controls on its screen. The fancy midi keyboard was back at full functionality. I was able to connect my CRT as a display again using the HDMI -> RCA converters I'd assumed had stopped working (nope! they still worked, they always worked!)\n\nWhich brings me to today. Almost a month later everything still works. So, I decided to see if remote desktop would magically work again. The answer is: Yes. Yes, in fact, my TV was the reason my remote desktop connection had failed the month before.\n\nSo here I am, sitting on my couch with my tablet and bluetooth keeb and mouse, writing this post in remote desktop mode so I could attach screenshots of this saga to my post without sitting at my PC. Grendel is snoring beside me as I write.\n\nAs a treat for reading this far, please enjoy two screenshots of my friends reacting to the solution of my great mystery.\n\nadding: the TV in question, in case you're curious: Hisense 50Q8G- 50\" Smart 4K ULED™ Android TV with Quantum Dot Technology (Canada Model)",

Today, they accessorize with sunglasses, unique outerwear, and sometimes flashy watches.\n\n\"They're getting a little more attention, and I think they like it,\" Victoria Hitchcock , a fashion lifestylist and personal brander in the San Francisco Bay area, told Business Insider.\n\nShe added: \"All of a sudden, they're standing out as potential future icons in areas they never intended to go.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook no further than Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg as a real example of this fashion upgrade to his techy street style. The Facebook founder might still be wearing the classic t-shirt and jeans, but he's recently opted to pair it with a chain necklace and New Balance sneakers.\n\nHitchcock told BI that Zuck's new style is part of a larger \"strategy\" over the last few years to \"make him approachable and show that he's a fun guy.\"\n\nHere's what Zuckerberg and his fellow wealthy tech titans are wearing this spring, according to style experts.\n\nThe shacket\n\nBill Gates, 68, remains on trend with what his fellow tech bosses are wearing.

This focus coincides with a growing trend of users signing in with their Microsoft accounts to access the full range of operating system features and functionalities. However, some recent design changes have caused user concern regarding the ease of logging out and the potential for promotional content within the Start menu.\n\nWindows 11 Account Management and User Experience Shifts\n\nChanges to the Account Menu: Navigating a New Landscape\n\nPreviously, the Start menu offered clear “Logout” and “Switch User” buttons. In the latest Windows 11 Insider build, these options have been relocated to the Account Manager section. Accessing this function now requires navigating through an additional menu and selecting a three-dot button. While the Account Manager provides a centralized hub for managing Microsoft subscriptions, services like Microsoft 365, and account notifications, locating the logout option within this new interface seems less intuitive.\n\nGizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram\n\nUser Perception and Microsoft’s Rationale\n\nSome users interpret this design shift as a deliberate attempt by Microsoft to delay the logout process, potentially exposing them to advertisements for services like Microsoft 365. Microsoft, on the other hand, maintains that the new design streamlines access to “account benefits” and simplifies account management.\n\nThe introduction of advertisements within the Start menu, such as the reported Opera browser promotion, has further fueled user concerns. While Microsoft emphasizes its goal of facilitating app discovery through these placements, some users perceive this as a prioritization of revenue generation over user experience.\n\nMoving Forward: Balancing Functionality and User Choice\n\nThe evolving account management landscape in Windows 11 presents both opportunities and challenges. While a centralized hub for account management offers convenience. A balance needs to be struck to ensure clear and readily accessible logout options. Similarly, the use of advertisements within the Start menu requires careful consideration to avoid alienating users. It will be interesting to see how Microsoft addresses these concerns and refines the user experience in future Windows 11 updates.",

        "text": "[Video] Microsoft Got Its Systems Cracked (Breached) Again, This Time by Russia, and It Uses Its Moles in the Press and So-called 'Linux' Foundation to Change the Subject\n\nposted by Roy Schestowitz on Apr 19, 2024,\n\nupdated Apr 19, 2024\n\n\n\nVideo download link | md5sum eba6c7b9ebb2b2e10fda19be8564cfec\n\nMicrosoft Staff Does Not Speak for Linux\n\nCreative Commons Attribution-No Derivative Works 4.0\n\n\n\nTWO days ago we mentioned how Microsoft employees kept speaking as if they were spokespeople for Linux, in effect bashing it on behalf of Microsoft.\n\nSounds familiar?\n\nAt the moment Microsoft has plenty to distract from, especially after CISA published official communications to that effect (\"CISA Issues Emergency Directive 24-02: Mitigating the Significant Risk from Nation-State Compromise of Microsoft Corporate Email System\", 2024-04-11).\n\nVery shortly later we saw lots of noise which we suspect can be attributed/related to that. Microsoft tries hard to 'hide' reports like these: \" US Cyber Agency Says Russian Hackers Used Microsoft Access to Steal Government Emails\", 2024-04-11.\n\nAn associate spotted this terrible Microsoft puff piece, arguing that it misrepresents Microsoft as an authority on anything other than getting breached (by Russia). They speak about \"Russia\", but it has nothing to do with the breach, e.g. \"Microsoft Finds Russian Influence Operations Targeting U.S. Election Have Begun\", 2024-04-17.\n\nThere are more instances like these, even in widely-read political sites, that we took note of and additional examples collected yesterday. This serves to distract from the national security danger Microsoft is - the chaos and mayhem of political/industrial espionage, owing to ransomware and worse things (like attacks on the water supply).\n\nThere are many more examples of this one and the Linux Foundation joined/chimed in on the same week. About 10 examples were amassed in the sister site, but quantity isn't what's important here. Nor does quality, but I saw close to a dozen blog posts and articles about \"Xz\" something, even 20 or so days after it was considered news. That's a lot more than I saw about the Russian breach/CISA affair (may be biased by the set of sites I've chosen to follow closely).\n\nIn IRC, parsifal told me \"the tin clanking continues,\" basically complaining that the Linux Foundation is at it again.\n\nShouldn't the Linux Foundation be boasting that GNU/Linux is secure while encouraging its adoption? Well, not when Microsoft employees (still on Microsoft's payroll) claim to be speaking for \"Linux\". Judging by this report, it's not only the Linux Foundation getting stacked but also the government. As an associate explains, the US government is worsening the Microsoft dependencies rather than ameliorating them and over at the Linux Foundation there are several Microsoft proxies with \"Open\" in their name, which means that the \"Linux\" Foundation is now a Microsoft mouthpiece that contributes to articles like \"Open source groups fear Xz repeat as suspicious messages fly\" (they're just looking for ways to bring up Xz again).\n\nThis is a disgusting war of propaganda, which I decided to explain using the video above. The sad thing is that a group of Microsoft employees inside the Linux Foundation (LF) more or less 'spams' the media, googlebombing 'linux' and bringing up 'Xz' again. \"Yes,\" an associate told me, \"there is a lot of LF spam now, mostly pushing Microsoft or other openwashing...\"\n\nOf course they also love blaming \"Linux\" any time there is some malware found on some machine, no matter how it got there or whose fault it was (administration mistakes, bad software, misconfiguration, no patching etc).\n\nWe can only hope that if we call out this kind of misdirection often enough, then writers will, perhaps in the future, be discouraged from repeating their error, either out of fear of backlash or merely recognition they got their stories wrong.\n\nBut that's assuming that those writers are honest people, not just marketing and propaganda agents who get assigned PR/SPAM pieces by the publisher, sponsored by companies such as Microsoft.\n\nJust to be clear, it's not only Microsoft bribing the media and nowadays the LF is yet another way in which Microsoft manipulates the media. If only they remembered who's behind OpenSSF and OpenJS. Inside the Linux Foundation there are Microsoft groups and it is not limited to that. LWN is also run by Linux Foundation people (Jon), so they're amplifying so much of the same messaging. In fact, a lot of sites or news \"sources\" are financially controlled by very few companies, interests, and sociopathic people like Bill Gates, who also infiltrates the so-called 'Linux' Foundation in several ways already. Then consider how Debian takes GAFAM money via SPI, so they too are unable to criticise the worst offenders, they actually actively suppress and censor people who 'disparage' sponsors (companies that bag hundreds of billions of dollars by spying and much worse).\n\nThe really sad thing is that sometimes their censorship succeeds and they point to things like \"Code of Conduct\" to justify the censorship. People eventually lose sight of the ball. Back doors of Microsoft are presumed good; those who oppose these back doors are \"zealots\". Suddenly the media alleges that the real \"back door\" issue is in Linux. If they control the narrative (or buy the narrative), they can do anything. █",
        "summary": "[Video] Microsoft Got Its Systems Cracked (Breached) Again, This Time by Russia, and It Uses Its Moles in the Press and So-called 'Linux' Foundation to Change the Subject\n\nposted by Roy Schestowitz on Apr 19, 2024,\n\nupdated Apr 19, 2024\n\n\n\nVideo download link | md5sum eba6c7b9ebb2b2e10fda19be8564cfec\n\nMicrosoft Staff Does Not Speak for Linux\n\nCreative Commons Attribution-No Derivative Works 4.0\n\n\n\nTWO days ago we mentioned how Microsoft employees kept speaking as if they were spokespeople for Linux, in effect bashing it on behalf of Microsoft. Very shortly later we saw lots of noise which we suspect can be attributed/related to that. There are many more examples of this one and the Linux Foundation joined/chimed in on the same week. As an associate explains, the US government is worsening the Microsoft dependencies rather than ameliorating them and over at the Linux Foundation there are several Microsoft proxies with \"Open\" in their name, which means that the \"Linux\" Foundation is now a Microsoft mouthpiece that contributes to articles like \"Open source groups fear Xz repeat as suspicious messages fly\" (they're just looking for ways to bring up Xz again). Just to be clear, it's not only Microsoft bribing the media and nowadays the LF is yet another way in which Microsoft manipulates the media. People eventually lose sight of the ball. Back doors of Microsoft are presumed good; those who oppose these back doors are \"zealots\"."

        "title": "Microsoft is mulling a change for widgets in Windows 11 that could prove controversial",
        "text": "Microsoft has deployed a new preview build of Windows 11 to the Canary channel (which is the earliest testing outlet) and it does some work on the widgets panel that could be divisive.\n\nThis is build 26200 and there’s only a handful of changes applied here, two of which pertain to widgets.\n\nThe main thrust of innovation here is Microsoft’s new idea to allow developers to send notifications from their widgets to the taskbar button. In other words, when something happens with a widget that you might want to see, it’ll be waving at you from the taskbar to let you know.\n\nOf course, not everyone will want their widget button in the taskbar to act in this way, and fortunately, Microsoft has included an option to turn off this behavior.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that this is a limited rollout to begin with, and indeed, most people won’t see these widget notifications yet – only those in the European Economic Area (EEA) are getting this feature in testing. Of course, that rollout could be made broader down the line, depending on feedback.\n\nAnother tweak related to this in build 26200 is that Microsoft is changing said widgets button to make the icons on the taskbar clearer.\n\nElsewhere on the taskbar, another icon is changing, this time the energy saver icon which resides in the system tray (on the far right). A few months back this was changed in testing to look different for desktop PCs plugged into a power socket, but now Microsoft has decided to revert it to the old look (a leaf icon).\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Get the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFinally, Microsoft notes that there is an odd known issue with this preview build – and others, in the Dev and Beta channels, too – whereby Copilot is auto-launching itself after the PC is rebooted.\n\nThe software giant explains this is not related to the automatic launch on boot behavior that has been tested in preview builds before, the rollout of which has now stopped, apparently, since March (though we heard it has been restarted elsewhere).\n\nThis is a separate glitch, then, and Microsoft says it hopes to have a fix implemented soon. Meanwhile, greater visibility for Copilot is something the company is certainly driving forward with, to no one’s surprise.\n\nAnalysis: A livelier taskbar won’t be everyone’s preferred beverage\n\nAre notifications for widgets intrusive? Well, yes they could certainly be regarded in that way, but as noted, as long as the option is provided to turn them off, it’s not too big a deal. If you want them, you can have them – if not, hit that off switch. Fair enough.\n\nMany people likely won’t want their widgets effectively waving their hands at them from the taskbar, whenever something new pops up with a widget in the panel. This taskbar-based hand-waving appears to be a direction Microsoft is exploring in more depth, though. We’ve also recently seen an idea where the Copilot button runs an animation with its icon to draw your attention to the fact that the AI can help with something you’re doing on the desktop.\n\nThis only relates to copying text or image files currently – again, in testing – but in this case, there’s no way to turn it off.\n\nAll this could possibly point to a taskbar which is considerably livelier and more animated in the future, perhaps – and again, that’s not something everyone will appreciate.\n\nIf this is the path we’re going down for the taskbar as we head towards next-gen Windows (which might be Windows 12), hopefully Microsoft will also give Windows users enough granular control over the bar’s highlighting features and animations so they can be dialed back suitably.",

        "text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works\n\nMicrosoft recently faced a double whammy from two of its former employees. One of them happens to be an ex-Windows UX head who took a slightly sarcastic dig at Microsoft for its introduction of more ads and promos via the Recommended section in the Start menu.\n\nThe other is also a former Windows engineer who labeled the performance of the Start menu as \"comically bad\" and wanted to bring the company's attention towards the apparent general 'unfinished' state of Windows 11.\n\nHowever, there is some positive development too. The Start menu on the newest Beta build, 22635.3500 (KB5036985), launched earlier today introduces grouping by letters in the \"All apps\" option in the Windows 11 Start menu. This should make it much more convenient to navigate through and find apps. It also looks far less cluttered.\n\nAnd this is in addition to the newly announced Microsoft Account (MSA) manager feature being added to the Start menu. The build also brings the ability to add MSA recovery mail address.\n\nHere is how the new Start menu with apps sorted by letters looks like (courtesy of Windows enthusiast and X user PhantomOcean3):\n\nThis is not the first instance in recent times that Microsoft is making a welcome Windows 11 Start menu change. Towards the end of last month, hidden inside Beta build 22635.3420, it introduced the grid view for the All Apps section, making it a lot easier to quickly navigate or scroll through the apps.\n\nAs mentioned, that was a highly requested feature and several of them happened to be related to the Start menu indicating that users want more changes here.\n\nHence, this continuous effort to improve the Start menu design is certainly something users will likely appreciate, considering the recent negative press coverage it garnered as a consequence of its stance towards adding ads and promos.",

Maybe I'll even finish it this time...\n\nOllie Reynolds, Staff Writer\n\nI’ve started playing Slave Zero X on the Switch (and keep an eye out for my review soon), but otherwise, much of my gaming time is being spent on the Xbox at the moment.

I also picked up Muramasa: The Demon Blade after reading Alana's anniversary feature on it, so that disk should be sliding into my Wii U, too. However, with the Game Boy turning 35, I want to squeeze in some quality time with my DMG-001. Or perhaps I should finally sit down to blast through the Link's Awakening remake on Switch instead? We'll see what I have time for. Have a good one, folks.\n\nFelix Sanchez, Video Producer\n\nThis weekend, I plan on playing Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney – Justice for All. I’ve finished the first two cases, and I'm dying to see what comes next. I especially liked the second case — it had a really cool plot and a nice plot twist at the end (hehe). I also have plans to meet with some friends where we are going to play TowerFall and WarioWare: Move It!

Gunstar Heroes and Metal Slug too!\n\n\n\nMy game of the week is Planet of Lana. It seems like forever since I first saw the release trailer for every other platform in existence, but at long last, this gem landed on Switch.

A girl can dream.\n\nCraig Reid, Video Producer (Pure Xbox)\n\nThanks to a certain good-time boy here at Nintendo Life, I am now completely and utterly obsessed with Pocket Card Jockey: Ride On! — those little horsies are so freaking adorable, I just can’t with their squishy heads! So, that’s most likely where you’ll find me for most of the weekend.\n\nSaying that though, I did just make a big money move on that ole’ Nintendo Store and invested in the Booster Course Pass for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Ironically, I haven’t touched the game since I bought it…mmm, I best get on it then, hey?\n\nOh, oh! I forgot! I’m enamoured with Fallout Shelter right now (I’ll give points for guessing why).

Happy gaming, folks!\n\nAlana Hagues, Deputy Editor\n\nNew Direct (read: Indie World) means more demos, right? Europa is on my list to dive into this weekend — I've loved the look of this since it was announced, and I'm so glad it's coming to Switch. Antonblast is also going on my download queue.\n\nI did pick up one of the shadowdrops during the Indie World — Sticky Business.

        "text": "There's something quietly quite exciting happening, and I wonder where it's going to lead. Earlier this week, Grounded - the Honey I Shrunk the Kids backyard survival game - arrived on PlayStation, and at the end of the month (30th April) pirating game Sea of Thieves arrives on PlayStation too. It's a momentous occasion, even though it might not sound it, because we've never had games conceived as Xbox exclusives arrive on PlayStation before. It's an unprecedented new approach by Microsoft and, should it work, it could open a whole Mary Poppins bag of possibility.\n\nI don't want to talk about the colder business case for it, because that's not what excites me. What excites me is what it means for players and, I suppose, for the games themselves. How wonderful it feels to be excited about these games again, which are now a number of years old. We first played Sea of Thieves in early 2018, and Grounded in mid-2020, and they were terrifically exciting then, but now they're not. They've been with us so long they've become familiar. No one's pulling you aside and asking you, raw enthusiasm in their eyes, if you've played them yet.\n\nWell, not yet.\n\nThis gradual fading away has nothing to do with the quality of the games. Both have evolved consistently and considerably, and are much fuller and more sophisticated experiences than they were. To compare them now and then would be unfair. But excitement does not correlate with a game's evolution. Yes, a player will probably have a better experience going back to those games now, but will they have a more exciting one? Moreover, will people still know what to do in the game or will they feel patched out?\n\nWhat I'm getting at here is that a game can only make a first impression once, as the cliché goes, and what's so exciting about this moment is these two games, Sea of Thieves and Grounded, get to do it again. They get another chance to excite a whole new audience - possibly one that has never even heard of them, depending on how entrenched in the PlayStation ecosystem they've been - and provide that fleeting, magical moment of shared discovery all over again.\n\nWhat magical moment is that? Think about when we first played that closed beta test of Sea of Thieves. I remember it so well. I remember everyone running around trying to figure out what the game was and how it worked. Even basic things like how to sail a ship weren't particularly well explained, so just getting out onto the open sea felt like an accomplishment. And once you did: wow! That sea. Then: another ship - friend or foe? It was a non-stop chain-reaction of firsts. Switch to Grounded and it's a similar thing. You don't forget the first time you walk around that small-made-big backyard world, and you certainly don't forget your first encounter with a spider.\n\nBut the impact of these experiences lessens with time and repetition. The next time you see a spider or a player ship, the experience won't thump as boisterously in your mind, because you've seen it before. Then the next time you see them, it will lessen further still, until soon you've smoothed away the extraordinary and transformed it into something ordinary. Diminishing returns have set in, and no matter what you or the game do to alleviate them, you never quite reach the same high.\n\nThe most powerful parts of a game experience, then, are the beginnings, when your mind is most sticky and available to them - like a fresh piece of Sellotape peeled from the reel. It's doubly and perhaps triply true for multiplayer games, which are magnified by everyone else's excitement as well. Some of my most cherished memories come from massively multiplayer games and the tornado of people racing to discover things first. I'll never forget downing raid bosses for the first time in World of Warcraft and the deafening cheers on voice comms that came after, or encountering players from enemy realms in Dark Age of Camelot for the first time and wondering what they were. The rush was intoxicating; I can still feel some of it, even now.\n\nSo yes, of course there's a colder business side to Grounded and Sea of Thieves arriving on PlayStation, but there's a warmer and more romantic side to it too. How magical it will be for people to imprint their minds for the very first time with these experiences, and how nice it will be for admirers of those games to see all these new people affected by them. And who knows what the knock-on effect of that will be? These years-old games might be rejuvenated beyond any success they previously experienced, and what then - what will that mean for them? No update or expansion could achieve such a thing. That's why I'm so excited. This, well, could change everything",
        "summary": "There's something quietly quite exciting happening, and I wonder where it's going to lead. What excites me is what it means for players and, I suppose, for the games themselves. How wonderful it feels to be excited about these games again, which are now a number of years old. They've been with us so long they've become familiar. No one's pulling you aside and asking you, raw enthusiasm in their eyes, if you've played them yet. What I'm getting at here is that a game can only make a first impression once, as the cliché goes, and what's so exciting about this moment is these two games, Sea of Thieves and Grounded, get to do it again. Think about when we first played that closed beta test of Sea of Thieves.

Last year, Filipino website Rappler created a brand aimed at young audiences by converting its long articles into comics, graphics and even videos.\n\nMedia professionals agree that their trade must now focus on tasks offering the greatest \"added value\".\n\n\"You're the one who is doing the real stuff\" and \"the tools that we produce will be an assistant to you,\" Google News general manager Shailesh Prakash told the festival in Perugia.\n\nAll about the money\n\nThe costs of generative AI have plummeted since ChatGPT burst onto the scene in late 2022, with the tool designed by US start-up OpenAI now accessible to smaller newsrooms.\n\nColombian investigative outlet Cuestion Publica has harnessed engineers to develop a tool that can delve into its archives and find relevant background information in the event of breaking news.\n\nBut many media organizations are not making their own language models, which are at the core of AI interfaces, said University of Amsterdam professor Natali Helberger. They are needed for \"safe and trustworthy technology\", he stressed.\n\nThe disinformation threat\n\nAccording to one estimate last year by Everypixel Journal, AI has created as many images in one year as photography in 150 years.\n\nThat has raised serious questions about how news can be fished out of the tidal wave of content, including deepfakes.\n\nMedia and tech organizations are teaming up to tackle the threat, notably through the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, which seeks to set common standards.\n\n\"The core of our job is news gathering, on-the-ground reporting,\" said Sophie Huet, recently appointed to become global news director for editorial innovation and artificial intelligence at Agence France-Presse.\n\n\"We'll rely for a while on human reporters,\" she added, although that might be with the help of artificial intelligence.\n\nFrom Wild West to regulation\n\nMedia rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders, which has expanded its media rights brief to defending trustworthy news, launched the Paris Charter on AI and journalism late last year.\n\n\"One of the things I really liked about the Paris Charter was the emphasis on transparency,\" said Anya Schiffrin, a lecturer on global media, innovation and human rights at Columbia University in the United States.\n\n\"To what extent will publishers have to disclose when they are using generative IA?\"\n\nOlle Zachrison, head of AI and news strategy at public broadcaster Swedish Radio, said there was \"a serious debate going on: should you mark out AI content or should people trust your brand?\"\n\nRegulation remains in its infancy in the face of a constantly evolving technology.\n\nIn March, the European Parliament adopted a framework law aiming to regulate AI models without holding back innovation, while guidelines and charters are increasingly common in newsrooms.\n\nAI editorial guidelines are updated every three months at India's Quintillion Media, said its boss Ritu Kapur.\n\nNone of the organization's articles can be written by AI and the images it generates cannot represent real life.\n\nResist or collaborate?\n\nAI models feed off data, but their thirst for the vital commodity has raised hackles among providers.\n\nIn December, the New York Times sued OpenAI and its main investor Microsoft for violation of copyright.\n\nIn contrast, other media organizations have struck deals with OpenAI: Axel Springer, US news agency AP, French daily Le Monde and Spanish group Prisa Media whose titles include El Pais and AS newspapers.\n\nWith resources tight in the media industry, collaborating with the new technology is tempting, explained Emily Bell, a professor at Columbia University's journalism school.\n\nShe senses a growing external pressure to \"Get on board, don't miss the train\".\n\n© 2024 AFP",

Initially, only a few paying Workspace customers could access the interoperability feature in beta mode. But now, Google has opened up the feature to everyone.\n\nHowever, if you're using Workspace and want to connect with Slack or Teams, you'll need to buy a Mio license too. The integration is powered by Mio, a company that specializes in making Workspace and Microsoft 365 play nice together.\n\nEven though you need Mio to translate between chat apps, it lets you do pretty much everything you'd expect. This means you can shoot messages and tag your colleagues, no matter which platform you're on.\n\nAccording to a blog post from Mio, you can do things like securely share files, edit or delete messages, throw in emojis, GIFs, and reactions, and even start threaded conversations, all across these platforms.\n\n(Image credit: Google)\n\nWhile the Mio solution might feel like a bit of a detour, it's definitely a step in the right direction. Regulators are cracking down on tech giants to make things work together better, and this feature, even with the extra tool, lets people chat across platforms without getting stuck in separate app silos. Maybe it's not a direct response, but it's a smart move to avoid future headaches.\n\nEven though Google opened this feature to everyone with Workspace, it doesn't work for regular users. For now, it's a perk for businesses on Workspace subscriptions.\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIf, like everyone else, you've juggled a hundred chat apps, missed messages, and felt like conversations are all over the place, the new feature, even with its quirks, is a big step towards breaking down those barriers. Imagine being able to chat with anyone on any platform, all from one place. Now that's a more unified way to communicate.",

After President Lagarde gave a nod to the June 6th meeting back in March, the messaging coming from various central bank members since then has been clear and nearly unanimous, if inflation continues to move lower, interest rates are coming down.

Though the market's rally has broadened this year, megacap stocks remain a portfolio staple, with fund managers in the latest BofA Global Research survey once again naming them the market's \"most crowded\" trade.Many believe their results could be especially important to markets this time around. The S&P 500 has slid in recent weeks, roughly halving its year-to-date gain to 5% as stickier-than-expected inflation erodes the prospects for the Federal Reserve to cut rates this year.Additionally, the monthslong rally in stocks has made the index expensive relative to history at a time when rising Treasury yields are pressuring equity valuations. Disappointing earnings from the market's heavyweights could give investors less reason to hold stocks.\"Psychologically, the companies coming in at or above expectations is important,\" said David Katz, chief investment officer with Matrix Asset Advisors. \"There's a lot of good news built into a lot of these companies.\"Investors will also focus on next Friday's release of the monthly Personal Consumption Expenditures Price index, a crucial piece of inflation data before the Fed's April 30-May 1 meeting. Fed funds futures late Thursday were pricing in less than 40 basis points in rate cuts this year, down from 150 bps expected at the start of 2024, according to LSEG data.The performance of megacaps' shares has diverged in 2024, after last year's epic run. Tesla, which reports results on Tuesday, has seen its shares tumble about 40% in 2024 amid concerns about its electric vehicle business.Meta Platforms, whose shares have jumped over 40% in 2024, is due on Wednesday, while Alphabet and Microsoft, which are logging year-to-date gains of about 12% and 7.5% respectively, are set for Thursday.Of the other megacaps, Apple and Amazon are set to report the following week, while Nvidia, whose shares have soared 70% this year on optimism over its artificial intelligence chips, reports on May 22.Six of the seven, excluding Tesla, are expected to post collective earnings growth of 42.1% in the first quarter, UBS strategists said on April 8.\"It appears that the expectations are that they're really going to deliver again,\" said Patrick Kaser, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global. \"And so the risk to me is skewed to the downside.\"Excluding the Magnificent 7, S&P 500 earnings have been negative on a year-over-year basis over the prior four quarters, according to JPMorgan analysts, underlining the group's importance to the market.Beyond the megacaps, over 300 S&P 500 companies expected to report over the coming two weeks. Earnings are expected to rise 9% for the full year, according to LSEG data, with added pressure on the results to support overall valuations.The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio has moderated somewhat this month but is still at 20 times, well above its long-term average of 15.7, according to LSEG Datastream.\"In an environment where there is a lot of uncertainty about Fed rate policy, there's a lot of geopolitical tensions rising, if companies aren't really pushing the pedal on giving positive outlooks for growth ... that could be the factor that weighs on stocks,\" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Aurora Ellis)",

        "text": "Essay by Eric Worrall\n\nTech giants which in public virtue signal their commitment to useless renewables are quietly arranging more potent and reliable energy sources for their own needs.\n\nDon’t let a hyper-data center suck up CT’s electric power by Bryan SaylesApril 19, 2024 @ 12:01 am Fred V. Carstensen’s March 22 “Opinion: CT SB299—afraid of the future, data centers and AI” ignores the legislative events and legitimate concerns that led to SB-299 being introduced in the first place. For starters, House Bill 6514 (HB-6514), a law passed in 2021, incentivizes data center development. Under HB-6514, any data center built or rehabilitated in Connecticut does not pay property or sales and use tax for the life of the facility, typically 20 to 30 years. Instead, it is required to pay the host municipality a Payment In Lieu Of Taxes (PILOT), an often absurdly low fee negotiated with the host municipality. … Siphoning 15% of nuclear power production to power Quinn’s Waterford data center will create grid scarcity. Instead of selling full capacity to the grid wholesale market, Dominion will only be offering 85% of daily capacity. That shortage will handicap wholesale electricity markets run by Independent System Operator-New England (ISO-New England). … Read more: https://ctmirror.org/2024/04/19/ct-data-center-nuclear-plant-bill/\n\n15% of the capacity of a nuclear power plant, for one data center?

Turns out all the tech giants want properly reliable energy for their data centers.\n\nAmazon, Google and Microsoft signal growing interest in nuclear, geothermal power Rising demand from artificial intelligence is forcing big technology companies to look beyond wind and solar for clean energy. By Heather Clancy\n\nMarch 25, 2024 The push to commercialize artificial intelligence is swelling the electricity demands of the three biggest cloud computing companies — Amazon, Google and Microsoft — and they’re looking for carbon-free energy, including nuclear and geothermal, to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from that growth. In mid-March, Talen Energy announced a $650 million deal with Amazon Web Services to sell a data center powered by one of the largest U.S. nuclear plants. The Pennsylvania campus hosts a 48-megawatt computing facility, and Amazon plans to build a 960-megawatt campus there. “To supplement our wind and solar energy projects, which depend on weather conditions to generate energy, we’re also exploring new innovations and technologies, and investing in other sources of clean, carbon-free energy,” Amazon said in a statement. “This agreement with Talen Energy is one project in that effort.” … Read more: https://www.greenbiz.com/article/amazon-google-and-microsoft-signal-growing-interest-nuclear-geothermal-power\n\nFrom Times of India;\n\nHow AI may force Google, Microsoft and others to push their nuclear energy game plan Sourabh Kulesh / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Mar 8, 2024, 14:14 IST Tech giants like Apple, Google and Microsoft are working to become carbon neutral in their operations by 2030. But as the next-gen AI technology grows, offices and data centres are becoming more energy-hungry. As per a report published last year, by 2027 AI servers may use between 85 to 134 terawatt hours (Twh) annually – which approximately equal to what Argentina, the Netherlands and Sweden each use in a year. To solve this problem, these companies have been pushing for nuclear energy as a source to power their AI tech. “If you were to integrate large language models, GPT-style models into search engines, it’s going to cost five times as much environmentally as standard search,” Sarah Myers West, managing director of the AI Now Institute, a research group focused on the social impacts of AI, recently told CNBC.\n\n\n\n… Last year, Microsoft agreed to buy power from Helion starting in 2028. Microsoft signed a deal last summer with Constellation, a top nuclear power plant operator, to add nuclear-generated electricity to its Virginia data centers. … Read more: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/how-ai-may-force-google-microsoft-and-others-to-push-their-nuclear-energy-game-plan/articleshow/108323674.cms\n\nDon’t forget, these are the same hypocrites who until recently were ignoring nuclear in public and pushing renewables, until they suddenly discovered they themselves needed reliable, industrial scale energy.\n\nFrom Google;\n\nFive years of 100% renewable energy – and a look ahead to a 24/7 carbon-free future June 24, 2022 Google operates the cleanest cloud in the industry, and we have long been a leading champion of clean energy around the world. Since we began purchasing renewable energy in 2010, Google has been responsible for more than 60 new clean energy projects with a combined capacity of over 7 gigawatts — about the same as 20 million solar panels.

APEC’s member economies play a critical role in advancing Microsoft’s and the world’s clean energy goals. The 21 economies account for more than half the world’s energy demand and over two-thirds’ the world’s electricity generation. … At Microsoft, our long-term vision is to reach a state where, on all the world’s grids, 100% of our electricity, 100% of the time, is generated from zero-carbon sources.

No imaginable internet network could carry all the data traffic which would be required to do everything remotely. So a lot of AI hardware will have to be installed in homes, right next to where it is used, to realise the full potential of the AI revolution.\n\nComputer manufacturers are already anticipating this demand for AI in the home, and are rushing to market with AI ready desktop and laptop computers. They are developing PCs filled with power hungry AI chips capable of efficiently executing massively parallel neural net programs, in addition to the usual graphics chips and CPUs.\n\nWhile initially these “AI ready” products will be quite rightly derided as a joke, a product looking for a purpose, it won’t take long for programmers and entrepreneurs to make them more interesting. The hunt is already on for the breakthrough software app which drives the next cycle of PC upgrades. I anticipate over the next 10 – 30 years power hungry AI systems will become increasingly integrated with all our lives, and everyone’s energy needs will surge.\n\nWe’ve barely scratched the surface of the surge in energy supply levels ordinary households could demand in the near future. As our houses will fill with machines which take care of everyday chores without any human intervention at all, the promise of AI is that within most of our lifetimes, everyone will have the opportunity to live like the rich people of today who have teams of servants looking out for all their needs, providing household energy supplies keep up with demand.\n\nIn the rush to automate everything, politicians who stand for green power rather than more power will be brushed aside.\n\nOf course, with every household running AI systems which emit thousands of watts of heat on a near continuous basis, people in urban areas will need more powerful air conditioners as well to deal with all that additional waste heat.\n\nImagine a large inner city apartment block, where every apartment’s energy use over the course of less than a decade goes up by an additional 3-4 thousand watts. That one large apartment block could be pumping megawatts of extra heat into the surrounding environment over today’s heat emissions, once all the near future AI toys are installed. And of course, that apartment block won’t be alone, all their neighbours will be doing the same. This coupled demand for energy and more air conditioning will likely create a positive feedback cycle of increasing energy use and urban heating, along with ever more powerful air conditioners to push back the rising urban heat load dumped into the environment by all those newly installed AI systems. The pump motors in those bigger air conditioners will themselves contribute to the surge in urban heat pollution.\n\nMy prediction, when the AI revolution really kicks in and reaches into every corner of everyone’s lives, the only reason for say installing rooftop solar will be if you need a small topup, because you can’t suck enough electricity out of the grid to run all your toys.\n\n4.7 18 votes Article Rating\n\nShare this: Print\n\nEmail\n\nX\n\nMore\n\nGETTR\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",
        "summary": "Essay by Eric Worrall\n\nTech giants which in public virtue signal their commitment to useless renewables are quietly arranging more potent and reliable energy sources for their own needs. Instead of selling full capacity to the grid wholesale market, Dominion will only be offering 85% of daily capacity. I decided to delve more deeply into this nuclear tech center controversy. In mid-March, Talen Energy announced a $650 million deal with Amazon Web Services to sell a data center powered by one of the largest U.S. nuclear plants. The Pennsylvania campus hosts a 48-megawatt computing facility, and Amazon plans to build a 960-megawatt campus there. “ Read more: https://www.greenbiz.com/article/amazon-google-and-microsoft-signal-growing-interest-nuclear-geothermal-power\n\nFrom Times of India;\n\nHow AI may force Google, Microsoft and others to push their nuclear energy game plan Sourabh Kulesh / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / Mar 8, 2024, 14:14 IST Tech giants like Apple, Google and Microsoft are working to become carbon neutral in their operations by 2030. To solve this problem, these companies have been pushing for nuclear energy as a source to power their AI tech. “ On the path to reaching this vision, our target is to cover 100% of Microsoft’s load with renewable energy purchases by 2025; meaning that we plan to have clean energy contracted for 100 percent of carbon emitting electricity consumed by all our data centers, buildings, and campuses. … So a lot of AI hardware will have to be installed in homes, right next to where it is used, to realise the full potential of the AI revolution. As our houses will fill with machines which take care of everyday chores without any human intervention at all, the promise of AI is that within most of our lifetimes, everyone will have the opportunity to live like the rich people of today who have teams of servants looking out for all their needs, providing household energy supplies keep up with demand. 4.7 18 votes Article Rating\n\nShare this: Print\n\nEmail\n\nX\n\nMore\n\nGETTR\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading..."

        "title": "How Big Tech Is Consuming America’s Electricity and Water",
        "text": "Skip to comments.\n\nHow Big Tech Is Consuming America’s Electricity and Water\n\nEpoch Times ^ | April 18, 2024 | Kevin Stocklin\n\nPosted on by george76\n\nAs federal net-zero policies attempt to shift transportation, heating, and other essentials onto the electric grid, one of the hottest growth sectors of America’s economy is poised to increase electricity demand exponentially, further straining an energy infrastructure that is being pushed into the red.\n\nData centers, the so-called “brains of the internet,” are industrial warehouses packed with rows upon rows of servers. They process, communicate, and store the data behind everything from bank records, online retailers, and social media platforms to Netflix shows and your personal iPhone videos.\n\n“Data centers are essential to cloud computing and its ability to give users remote access to data,” a 2023 Federal Reserve report states, quoting a Science article that calls them the “information backbone of an increasingly digitalized world.”\n\nMany analysts laud data centers as one of the fastest-growing sectors of the real estate market, but the industry may soon find itself hitting a wall as local communities put up increasing resistance to the industry’s seemingly insatiable appetite for power and water.\n\n“While other commercial real estate sectors are experiencing a decline in construction pipelines, data center development has reached an all-time high,” according to a January report by Newmark, a commercial real estate advisory.\n\n“However, growth is increasingly constrained by land and power availability, supply chain challenges and construction delays, not to mention increasing resistance from some local jurisdictions.”\n\nThe report said the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies is fueling the demand.\n\nThe industry is led by cloud computing behemoths like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Meta. It also includes digital landlords, called co-location companies, which rent storage space out to third parties. These include Equinix, Digital Realty, and CyrusOne.\n\nElectricity Demand From Data to Double by 2030..\n\nData warehouses consumed 17 gigawatts of electricity in 2022, or about 4 percent of total U.S. consumption. This is projected to double to 35 gigawatts by 2030.\n\nEric Woodell, who holds a doctorate of science in information systems and communications and is the founder of Amerruss, a tech infrastructure management company, referred to data centers as “energy hogs.”\n\n“But now your data center for AI applications is no longer a hog, it’s an elephant and it’s living in your backyard,” he told The Epoch Times.\n\nMr. Woodell has been managing data centers for 25 years, formerly for Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager.\n\nA mere 10-foot-square space within the average data center consumes about 10 times as much electricity as the average home,\n\n...\n\n“While conventional data centers are already pulling an enormous amount of power, AI computing doesn’t use CPUs [central processing units], but GPU-based systems instead, as the GPUs [graphics processing units] are tailored to better handle complex mathematical functions,” he said. “But there’s a catch: they draw between five and 10 times more power than similarly equipped CPU systems.”\n\nThis hefty increase in electricity demand strains a grid that is already predicted to feature power shortages and routine rolling blackouts in the coming years. This is due to more demands being placed on the grid at a time when utilities are aggressively shutting down coal and gas plants in their transition to wind and solar energy.\n\nAccording to a February case study of one large regional electric utility, PJM, by Quanta Technologies, the next several years will feature “equipment overloads that trigger as much as 6,826 MW of load shedding during average winter peak demand.”\n\nLoad shedding means cutting power to consumers, also known as blackouts, to prevent a system collapse.\n\n...\n\nPJM forecasts new data center load growth of 7,500 MW by 2028, while deactivating 11,100 MW of fossil fuel production, leaving an 18.6 Gigawatt gap between new demand and remaining supply in this sector, according to Mr. Woodell.\n\n“18.6 Gigawatts would power roughly 3 million homes or New York City three times over,” he stated. “The ramifications are massive.”\n\nData Center Alley..\n\nGlobally, data centers consume about 3 percent of the world’s electricity, according to Ryan Yonk, an economist at the American Institute for Economic Research. This consumption tends to be steady and predictable, and utilities can expand to accommodate it, he said.\n\nHowever, problems arise when centers become concentrated in a single area, especially if that area is transitioning away from fossil fuels.\n\n...\n\nThe problem for local communities is that, once a municipality approves the development, the electric utility must build new power generation and transmission lines to service that development. The cost of this new infrastructure is largely borne by the community in the form of higher electric bills for all ratepayers.\n\n“When we pay our electric bills each month, you’re giving a huge subsidy to multibillion-dollar companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple,” the PEC report states.\n\nAs a result, data centers are increasingly facing local resistance when they try to build new facilities.\n\n...\n\nSearching for New Places to Build..\n\nConsequently, developers have started looking elsewhere in search of land, cheap energy, and abundant groundwater. Target locations include Atlanta, Georgia, and Columbus, Ohio. Cheyenne, Wyoming has also approved significant data center development.\n\nData center developers are also seeking locations abroad. The BBC reported in June of 2023 that data centers used about one-fifth of all electricity in the Republic of Ireland, the equivalent of the electricity used in all the country’s urban districts combined.\n\nEnergy consumption in Ireland by these data warehouses increased 31 percent from 2021 to 2022, and by 400 percent since 2015\n\n...\n\nIn Europe and in the UK they’ve basically put moratoriums in place on any new data center builds because there’s just not enough power.”\n\nAnd the drain on local resources goes beyond electricity, it includes water usage as well.\n\nData centers concentrate a significant amount of power in a small space, generating more heat than air cooling alone can mitigate. Consequently, they consume enormous amounts of groundwater to keep the servers from overheating.\n\n...\n\nGoogle, for example, reported that it consumed 5.6 billion gallons of water in 2022, primarily to cool its data centers. This was a 20 percent increase over what it used in 2021.\n\nThe Fed report stated that the data center industry ranked among the 10 largest industries for water consumption in 2021.\n\n...\n\nTypically, he said, on top of the electricity used to power the computers, an additional 40 percent on average is required to cool them. This puts an additional strain on electric grids and consumes enormous volumes of local groundwater in the process.\n\nCan Data Centers Thrive Under the Sea?\n\nCompanies like Microsoft, Subsea Cloud, and some Chinese competitors believe that they have found a solution: sink data centers offshore inside deep-water pods.\n\nThese companies have developed new technologies that can house data centers in coastal waters, thousands of feet below the surface.\n\n...\n\nThe normal operating temperature of a computer chip is above 70 degrees Celsius (158 degrees Fahrenheit), so that even in tropical waters “you still have a difference between the water and the chip that’s so big, it will transfer this heat away from the chips without spending any energy to do it,” Mr. Williams said.\n\nHowever, where Microsoft has constructed data tanks with five-inch thick steel walls to keep deep-sea pressure from crushing the tanks, Subsea Cloud fills its tanks with a patented non-corrosive fluid, using solid-state drives that can function in a liquid environment. This serves two functions.\n\n...\n\n“Number one, it’s transferring the heat very efficiently,” Mr. Williams said. “Number two, it’s maintaining a pressure inside of the pod that is equal to the outside.” This requires the walls of the undersea pods to be only one-quarter of an inch thick.\n\nWhile it took some convincing to get tech companies to consider an underwater alternative, the demand for undersea pods is “huge at the moment,” he said.\n\n“We are very lucky to be in a spot where very large companies are talking to us—and governments, too. The fact is that it doesn’t look like the world population wants to scale back on the use of electronics and AI and all of that.”\n\nSubmersible data pods may help to reduce the land, electricity, and groundwater required to feed the growing demand from data centers, but ultimately the global data industry will still need vast amounts of power to fuel its growth, which will continue to strain power grids.\n\nMr. Woodell says that one day soon, the tech industry will have to either innovate dramatic new efficiencies in data processing or face practical and regulatory roadblocks to further growth.\n\n\n\nTOPICS:\n\nBusiness/Economy\n\nNews/Current Events\n\nPolitics/Elections\n\nKEYWORDS:\n\nbigtech\n\nelectricgrid\n\nelectricity\n\nenergy\n\ninfrastructure\n\nnetzero\n\nwater\n\nClick here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo: george76\n\nBookmark\n\n\n\nby 2 posted onby Southside_Chicago_Republican (God save the United States!)\n\nTo: george76\n\nSaid another way windmills and solar panels won’t do the job.

        "text": "NVIDIA's early engineering sample of the RTX 2070, known as the GeForce GTX 2070, has been spotted and features lower cores than the original variant.\n\nNVIDIA's Only \"GTX\" 20 Series GPU Spotted: An Engineering Sample Labeled As The GeForce RTX 2070\n\nNVIDIA's GeForce \"GTX\" labeling was used up till the GeForce 10 and GeForce 16 series GPUs. Everything after these GPUs was labeled under the GeForce \"RTX\" series but it looks like the company had internally labeled the RTX 20 series as GTX 20 series as one such model has now surfaced online.\n\nPictures posted by @unnatural__log show a peculiar NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 GPU which is mentioned to be an engineering sample which explains why it doesn't use the \"RTX\" labeling.\n\nImage Source: @unnatural__log\n\nIn terms of design, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 2070 Engineering Sample features the same design as the GeForce RTX 2070. It has the same dual axial fan cooler with the dual-slot design but the label on the sides reads \"GeForce GTX\" and there's no \"GTX 2070\" or \"RTX 2070\" on the front. The card has a few missing labels but besides that, there are no big differences. The display ports include the same HDMI, 2x DP, USB Type-C VirtualLink port, and a DVI output. The card should feature a standard 8-pin connector since this was before the time NVIDIA switched to the 12-pin or 16-pin interfaces.\n\nImage Source: @unnatural__log\n\nThe PCB of the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 2070 Engineering Sample also matches the reference design but its the specifications that are the biggest change. While the RTX 2070 featured 2304 cores, the GTX 2070 ES GPU features 2176 cores and is based on the TU106-400A-A1 GPU with the device ID being \"10DE-1F07 - 10DE-12AD\". This is the same core configuration used by the RTX 2060 SUPER which featured the TU106-410-A1 GPU.\n\n2 of 9\n\nBased on the testing done by the user, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 2070 Engineering Sample GPU was flashed with the BIOS of an RTX 2070 \"400A BIOS\" which doesn't change the device ID nor unlock the extra cores but it does grants some extra power to the GPU core which can be used for manual tweaking. With OC, the GPU ended up with around 95% of the performance of the RTX 2070, or a 16 percent boost over its default profile. That's a pretty decent bump considering that we don't get to see such gain on modern-day GPUs anymore since they are already running at clock speeds way above their listed \"peak boost\" clock speeds.\n\nOverall, this shows that there was a time when NVIDIA hadn't decided to use the \"RTX\" branding for its upcoming Turing GPUs which ended up becoming the first \"RTX\" GPUs, thus ending the reign of the GeForce \"GTX\" series. NVIDIA has also sized the production of the last GeForce GTX GPUs which means that it's all RTX from now onward unless NVIDIA decides to move to a new branding in the future.",

        "title": "All of the exciting new GPUs still coming in 2024",
        "text": "It’s already been an exciting year for graphics cards, but things are really about to start heating up. A series of leaks and rumors over the past year suggest that Nvidia, AMD, and Intel will all launch new GPU generations in the back half of 2024, with the three graphics behemoths’ offerings duking it out for a slot among the best graphics cards.\n\nWe’ve already seen graphics cards like the RX 7600 XT and RTX 4070 Super this year, but there could be many more in the tank. Although each of the three major graphics brands have confirmed that next-gen GPUs are on the way, none of them have laid out a specific timeline. So, with the understanding that these release windows are still speculative, these are the GPUs launching this year that we’ll all be talking about heading into 2025.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nNvidia — RTX 50-series (Blackwell)\n\nWe originally expected Nvidia’s RTX 50-series GPUs — code-named Blackwell — to launch in early 2025, but recent rumors suggest the launch date is closer than that. Graphics card vendors have reportedly shared that the first two Nvidia GPUs in the next generation will release in the last few months of 2024. That would line up with Nvidia’s normal release cadence. The RTX 40-series launched in October 2022, while the RTX 30-series launched in September 2020.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nIn addition, a report from UDN says that industry analysts are positive about Nvidia’s typical biennial release structure, and they’re expecting an uptick in shipments in the back half of the year.\n\nOn top of the speculation, Nvidia has already launched its Blackwell architecture. The company introduced its Blackwell data center GPU, the B200, in March. In the last two generations, Nvidia launched data center GPUs sporting its next-gen architecture about six months before the consumer range released.\n\nNvidia won’t dump all of its new graphics cards right away, however. If RTX 40-series GPUs arrive this year, I suspect Nvidia will release two of them. Presumably, the RTX 5090 would arrive first, and then the RTX 5080 would show up about a month later. Nvidia hasn’t confirmed those names or that timeline, but it would line up with what we’ve seen in the past two generations.\n\nAlthough signs point to Nvidia releasing Blackwell in the back half of the year, it’s possible things could slip into 2025. Nvidia has the advantage of being the market leader when it comes to GPUs, so it can sit by and wait to respond to what AMD and Intel have cook up. That’s a strategy we saw with the recent Super refresh to RTX 40-series GPUs, with cards like the RTX 4080 Super being a direct response to AMD’s lineup.\n\nAMD — RX 8000 series (RDNA 4)\n\nAMD is in a different position than Nvidia. As a company that releases both CPUs and GPUs, we can trace back its normal release cadence between the two product groups. AMD released its Zen 4 CPUs in September 2022, and its RX 7000 GPUs followed up in December that same year. Recent indicators suggest AMD is releasing Zen 5 CPUs in the next few months, setting up the RX 8000 for a launch later this year.\n\nThis alone is just speculation, but it’s backed up by close to a year of leakers claiming a similar timeline. Most agree that the GPUs are arriving in the second half of the year, but they disagree on the exact timing. Moore’s Law is Dead, a well-known leaker, claims to have sources within AMD that say the cards could arrive as soon as early fall if AMD wants to “rush.” However, all of the leakers’ sources claim that a winter release, either in late 2024 or early 2025, is more likely.\n\nA big reason for the loose release schedule is that AMD is rumored to ditch high-end GPU options for its next-gen cards. The leaker crowd says that AMD is using its Navi 48 GPU as the flagship option, which is said to target a midrange segment. Given that Nvidia is only expected to launch its high-end options this year, it’s possible AMD could wait to see if this rumor holds up.\n\nAlthough it’s tempting to blindly follow what the rumors say, there are some things that don’t add up. Both Moore’s Law is Dead and RedGamingTech claim that AMD will use a monolithic die for RDNA 4, and that doesn’t line up with what we’ve seen. Current-gen RDNA 3 GPUs like the RX 7900 XTX use a Multi-Chip Module (MCM) design, which AMD has seen great success with via its Ryzen CPUs. It doesn’t make much sense for AMD to ditch this design in the next generation.\n\nAll of that is to say that the rumor about AMD ditching high-end GPUs in the next generation is a bit flimsy. For now, it’s safe to say that AMD is likely targeting a late 2024 release for its RDNA 4 GPUs, and it’s even possible we could see a tease of them at this year’s Computex.\n\nIntel — BXXX (Battlemage)\n\nRounding out the list is Intel Battlemage, which could be the first of the three we see this year. Intel has been surprisingly transparent on the progress of Battlemage, and things are already shaping up. At the beginning of the year, Intel’s Tom Petersen said that the hardware for Battlemage was already finished, claiming that about 30% of Intel’s graphics engineers were working on drivers.\n\nMore recently, a shipping manifest showing two Battlemage GPUs made the rounds. These weren’t shipping to customers, with the manifest showing that they were “for R&D purposes only,” but it shows that Battlemage is likely entering the final stages of validation. That lines up with a road map that was leaked last year, which showed Battlemage GPUs arriving between April and June of 2024.\n\nIntel is slated to give a keynote presentation at Computex this year, which takes place in June. Although Intel will likely talk about its enterprise and AI efforts, it’s possible we could see Battlemage on the consumer front. We don’t expect Intel to talk about its next-gen CPUs at Computex, at least, leaving only Battlemage for consumer announcements.\n\nAs for what GPUs Intel will launch, it’s hard to say. The Arc A770 and A750 were the company’s first discrete GPUs, so we don’t have an established release cadence like we do with Nvidia and AMD. If Intel sticks with what it did in the previous generation, we’ll see two main GPUs release with Battlemage, and perhaps some lower-end options in 2025.\n\nRumor has it that Intel is targeting the performance of an RTX 4070 for its flagship card. If that’s the case, Intel will want at least a few months on the market uncontested by Nvidia and AMD. We saw that strategy with the A770 and A750, so it makes sense that Intel would use it again this generation.\n\nStill an exciting year\n\nGraphics cards work in two-year chunks, and 2024 is an exciting year no matter how you slice it. With Intel, AMD, and Nvidia already through their current-gen releases, and even a Super refresh behind us, it’s time for the next generation to show up. The timelines are still fuzzy, but one thing is for sure — next-gen GPUs are arriving in short order.\n\nIf you’re planning on upgrading your PC, it might make sense to wait until we see what the rest of the year holds. GPU prices are already dropping for multiple cards, clearing the shelves for new options at the end of the year.\n\nEditors' Recommendations",

        "text": "watch now\n\nHELL'S GATE, Kenya — Two-and-a-half hours northwest of Nairobi by car, a small group of bitcoin miners set up shop at the site of an extinct volcano near Hell's Gate National Park. The mine, tucked away on the edge of Lake Naivasha, is operated by a startup called Gridless and consists of a single 500-kilowatt mobile container that, from the outside, looks like a small residential trailer. Backed by Jack Dorsey's Block , Gridless electrifies its machines with a mix of solar power and the stranded, wasted energy from a nearby geothermal site. It's one of six mines run by the company in Kenya, Malawi and Zambia, powered by a mix of renewable inputs and working toward a broader mission of securing and decentralizing the bitcoin network.\n\nGridless runs Gridlesin Hell's Gate operates on geothermal power. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\n\"Most people think about bitcoin and the price of bitcoin and how they can save value in it or maybe spend it,\" Gridless CEO Erik Hersman told CNBC during a visit to the Kenyan mine earlier this year. \"That doesn't happen without the bitcoin miners and us being globally distributed.\" Decentralization is a key feature of bitcoin, because it means the network isn't controlled by any entity and can't be shut down — even if a government disapproves. Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies are created through a process known as proof-of-work, in which miners around the world run high-powered computers that collectively validate transactions and simultaneously create new tokens. The process requires heaps of electricity, leading miners to seek out the cheapest sources of power. While there are more than a dozen publicly traded miners, thousands of smaller, private operations are also competing to process transactions and get paid in new bitcoin. That includes individual miners in countries from Venezuela to Lebanon, and can involve a single mining rig in a kitchen or several hundred thousand of them in an industrial-grade datacenter.\n\nGridless runs a geothermal-powered bitcoin mine in Hell's Gate on the shore of Lake Naivasha. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\nWherever the operation, bitcoin mining is a volatile business, because so much of the economics depends on the price of the cryptocurrency. Since losing 60% of its value in 2022, bitcoin has come roaring back, hitting a record above $73,000 in March, before pulling back a bit in recent weeks. Much of the rally has been tied to the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S., as well as optimism surrounding the so-called halving that took place late Friday. That event occurs every four years and is designed to cut the reward for bitcoin miners in half, reducing the pace at which new bitcoins enter the market. Prior halving events have been followed by big run-ups in the cryptocurrency. \"Bitcoin is effectively unbreakable at this point,\" said Adam Sullivan, CEO of Core Scientific , a bitcoin miner based in Texas. \"Bitcoin is at a point where it is more profitable to continue supporting the network than to try and break it.\" Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note on April 18 that they expect the geography of crypto mining to shift after the halving as slimmer profit margins force miners to seek cheaper and more reliable forms of energy. The analysts wrote that the U.S. currently accounts for 40% of mining, with Russia at 20% and China at 15%. \"Latin America, Africa and the Middle East have caught the attention of crypto miners due to their lower energy costs,\" they wrote. Bitfarms, based in Toronto, is now operating in Argentina, while Marathon Digital , headquartered in Florida, has expanded into the United Arab Emirates and Paraguay. Hersman, 48, was raised in Kenya and Sudan, where his parents were linguists. Before getting into bitcoin mining, he and his two co-founders, Philip Walton and Janet Maingi, spent years building internet connectivity infrastructure in rural and urban Africa.\n\nGridless runs bitcoin mines in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia on a mix of renewable energy sources. The company's site in Hell's Gate operates on geothermal power. MacKenzie Sigalos\n\nIn early 2022, the trio began brainstorming creative solutions for the divide between power generation and capacity, and the lack of access to electricity in Africa. They landed on the idea of bitcoin mining, which could potentially solve a big problem for renewable energy developers by taking their stranded power and spreading it to other parts of the continent. In Africa, 43% of the population, or roughly 600 million people, lack access to electricity. Gridless now has eight full-time staffers and manages much of its operations remotely with its software.\n\nTurning lava into bitcoin\n\nHell's Gate is a deep and winding canyon that is home to cheetahs, zebras, and giraffes and rimmed by cliffs, volcanoes and thick bush. The area is covered in ash, and sulfuric plumes of steam will periodically emit from the ground, a reminder of the surrounding, smoldering volcanic craters that wiped out some of the native Maasai tribe in the mid-19th century and threatened others who dared to take up residence there. Gone are the days of fatal eruptions and spewing lava. Instead, an elaborate, labyrinthine piping system and volcanic plugs comprise multiple geothermal power stations.\n\nA drilling hole at the Olkaria geothermal power station in Hell´s Gate National Park. Getty Images/Michael Gottschalk\n\nVolcano-powered bitcoin mining isn't new. Iceland, El Salvador and other countries have been harnessing geothermal energy to mine bitcoin. To make the conditions work for miners, the businesses need the combination of a buy-in from local authorities, cheap and abundant power and some infrastructure, said Nic Carter, founding partner of Castle Island Ventures, which focuses on blockchain investments. \"If you have those three ingredients, it can work, but sometimes, it's the nation state, or a national, state energy company doing it,\" Carter said. He pointed to the Middle East, which is getting into flare gas mining as an example of state-level actors entering the business. \"In some cases, it's with the explicit blessing of the nation state like Bhutan, and then in Texas, it's just with very favorable local regulators and local conditions,\" he said. Africa is home to an estimated 10 terawatts of solar capacity, 350 gigawatts of hydro and another 110 gigawatts of wind. Some of this renewable energy is being harnessed already, but a lot isn't because building the specialized infrastructure to capture it is expensive. Even with 60% of the best solar resources globally, Africa only has 1% of installed solar PV capacity. Enter bitcoin miners. Bitcoin gets a bad rap for the amount of energy it consumes, but it can also help unlock these trapped renewable sources of power. Miners are essentially energy buyers, and co-locating with renewables creates a financial incentive to bolster production. \"As often happens, you'll have an overage of power during the day or even at night, and there's nobody to soak that power up,\" said Hersman. He said his company's 50-kilowatt mining container can \"take up whatever is extra throughout the day.\"\n\nSteam tubes at the Olkaria geothermal power station in Hell´s Gate National Park. Getty Images/Michael Gottschalk\n\n\"Within any second or minute, we are going up and down on a certain number of miners that are running,\" Hersman said. \"It might be down to 50 kilowatts, then up to 300 kilowatts, then down to 200 kilowatts, and then up to another level — and that will happen all day and all night.\" According to the International Energy Agency, in Africa's rural areas, \"where over 80% of the electricity-deprived live, mini-grids and stand-alone systems, mostly solar based, are the most viable solutions.\" Demand from bitcoin miners on these semi-stranded assets is making renewables in Africa economically viable. The power supplier benefits from selling energy that previously had been discarded, while the energy plants will sometimes lower costs for the customer. At one of the Gridless pilot sites in Kenya, the hydro plant dropped the price of power from 35 cents per kilowatt hour to 25 cents per kWh. The buildout of capacity is also electrifying households. Gridless says its sites have powered 1,200 houses in Zambia, 1,800 in Malawi and 5,000 in Kenya. The company's mines also have delivered power for containerized cold storage for local farmers, battery charging stations for electric motorcycles and public WiFi points. \"It's not really sexy,\" Hersman said. \"It's a mining container made from a shipping container. It's got a bunch of dumb machines sitting in it running the same equation over and over again, but it's actually what secures the network.\"",

        "title": "This Week in AI: When ‘open source’ isn’t so open",
        "text": "Keeping up with an industry as fast-moving as AI is a tall order. So until an AI can do it for you, here’s a handy roundup of recent stories in the world of machine learning, along with notable research and experiments we didn’t cover on their own.\n\nThis week, Meta released the latest in its Llama series of generative AI models: Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B. Capable of analyzing and writing text, the models are “open sourced,” Meta said — intended to be a “foundational piece” of systems that developers design with their unique goals in mind.\n\n“We believe these are the best open source models of their class, period,” Meta wrote in a blog post. “We are embracing the open source ethos of releasing early and often.”\n\nThere’s only one problem: the Llama 3 models aren’t really “open source,” at least not in the strictest definition.\n\nOpen source implies that developers can use the models how they choose, unfettered. But in the case of Llama 3 — as with Llama 2 — Meta has imposed certain licensing restrictions. For example, Llama models can’t be used to train other models. And app developers with over 700 million monthly users must request a special license from Meta.\n\nDebates over the definition of open source aren’t new. But as companies in the AI space play fast and loose with the term, it’s injecting fuel into long-running philosophical arguments.\n\nLast August, a study co-authored by researchers at Carnegie Mellon, the AI Now Institute and the Signal Foundation found that many AI models branded as “open source” come with big catches — not just Llama. The data required to train the models is kept secret. The compute power needed to run them is beyond the reach of many developers. And the labor to fine-tune them is prohibitively expensive.\n\nSo if these models aren’t truly open source, what are they, exactly? That’s a good question; defining open source with respect to AI isn’t an easy task.\n\nOne pertinent unresolved question is whether copyright, the foundational IP mechanism open source licensing is based on, can be applied to the various components and pieces of an AI project, in particular a model’s inner scaffolding (e.g. embeddings). Then, there’s the mismatch between the perception of open source and how AI actually functions to overcome: open source was devised in part to ensure that developers could study and modify code without restrictions. With AI, though, which ingredients you need to do the studying and modifying is open to interpretation.\n\nWading through all the uncertainty, the Carnegie Mellon study does make clear the harm inherent in tech giants like Meta co-opting the phrase “open source.”\n\nOften, “open source” AI projects like Llama end up kicking off news cycles — free marketing — and providing technical and strategic benefits to the projects’ maintainers. The open source community rarely sees these same benefits, and, when they do, they’re marginal compared to the maintainers’.\n\nInstead of democratizing AI, “open source” AI projects — especially those from big tech companies — tend to entrench and expand centralized power, say the study’s co-authors. That’s good to keep in mind the next time a major “open source” model release comes around.\n\nHere are some other AI stories of note from the past few days:\n\nMeta updates its chatbot: Coinciding with the Llama 3 debut, Meta upgraded its AI chatbot across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp — Meta AI — with a Llama 3-powered backend. It also launched new features, including faster image generation and access to web search results.\n\nCoinciding with the Llama 3 debut, Meta upgraded its AI chatbot across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp — Meta AI — with a Llama 3-powered backend.

OpenAI lands in Japan: OpenAI is expanding to Japan, with the opening of a new Tokyo office and plans for a GPT-4 model optimized specifically for the Japanese language.\n\nMore machine learnings\n\nCan a chatbot change your mind? Swiss researchers found that not only can they, but if they are pre-armed with some personal information about you, they can actually be more persuasive in a debate than a human with that same info.\n\n“This is Cambridge Analytica on steroids,” said project lead Robert West from EPFL. The researchers suspect the model — GPT-4 in this case — drew from its vast stores of arguments and facts online to present a more compelling and confident case. But the outcome kind of speaks for itself. Don’t underestimate the power of LLMs in matters of persuasion, West warned: “In the context of the upcoming US elections, people are concerned because that’s where this kind of technology is always first battle tested. One thing we know for sure is that people will be using the power of large language models to try to swing the election.”\n\nWhy are these models so good at language anyway? That’s one area there is a long history of research into, going back to ELIZA. If you’re curious about one of the people who’s been there for a lot of it (and performed no small amount of it himself), check out this profile on Stanford’s Christopher Manning. He was just awarded the John von Neuman Medal; congrats!\n\nIn a provocatively titled interview, another long-term AI researcher (who has graced the TechCrunch stage as well), Stuart Russell, and postdoc Michael Cohen speculate on “How to keep AI from killing us all.” Probably a good thing to figure out sooner rather than later! It’s not a superficial discussion, though — these are smart people talking about how we can actually understand the motivations (if that’s the right word) of AI models and how regulations ought to be built around them.\n\nThe interview is actually regarding a paper in Science published earlier this month, in which they propose that advanced AIs capable of acting strategically to achieve their goals, which they call “long-term planning agents,” may be impossible to test. Essentially, if a model learns to “understand” the testing it must pass in order to succeed, it may very well learn ways to creatively negate or circumvent that testing. We’ve seen it at a small scale, why not a large one?\n\nRussell proposes restricting the hardware needed to make such agents… but of course, Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs just got their deliveries. LANL just had the ribbon-cutting ceremony for Venado, a new supercomputer intended for AI research, composed of 2,560 Grace Hopper Nvidia chips.\n\nAnd Sandia just received “an extraordinary brain-based computing system called Hala Point,” with 1.15 billion artificial neurons, built by Intel and believed to be the largest such system in the world. Neuromorphic computing, as it’s called, isn’t intended to replace systems like Venado, but to pursue new methods of computation that are more brain-like than the rather statistics-focused approach we see in modern models.\n\n“With this billion-neuron system, we will have an opportunity to innovate at scale both new AI algorithms that may be more efficient and smarter than existing algorithms, and new brain-like approaches to existing computer algorithms such as optimization and modeling,” said Sandia researcher Brad Aimone. Sounds dandy… just dandy!",
        "summary": "Keeping up with an industry as fast-moving as AI is a tall order. There’s only one problem: the Llama 3 models aren’t really “open source,” at least not in the strictest definition. For example, Llama models can’t be used to train other models. The data required to train the models is kept secret. And the labor to fine-tune them is prohibitively expensive. So if these models aren’t truly open source, what are they, exactly?

        "title": "Dell XPS 14 (9440)",
        "text": "Dell's consumer flagship XPS laptops always flaunt an extra-fancy feature or two. (We're glad these days it's an LED touch-strip key row instead of a webcam aimed up your nose.) The new XPS 14 (model 9440, starting at $1,699; $2,099 as tested) shows off the flashy top row and seamless haptic touchpad that premiered in the Dell XPS 13 Plus, plus Intel's latest AI-enhanced silicon and Microsoft's dedicated key for AI-enhanced Windows Copilot. The Dell XPS 14 is a sleek and swift performer, but its only advantages over other slimline laptops are a barely larger 14.5-inch display and an optional discrete GPU for more content-creation performance. With that, the Asus Zenbook 14X OLED (UX3404) remains our Editors' Choice award holder for high-end ultraportable laptops, while Asus' own Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406) presents a similar experience for half the XPS 14's price.\n\nConfigurations and Design: Meteor Lake or Bust\n\nWhile Intel's Core Ultra 7 155H is the only processor choice you have at checkout, our review unit has the $400-extra 6GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 in place of the standard Intel Arc integrated graphics. Otherwise, this unit has base-model specs with 16GB of memory, a 512GB NVMe solid-state drive, Windows 11 Home, and an IPS screen with a 1,920-by-1,200-pixel resolution and variable 60Hz or 120Hz refresh rate (no touch control here). A tempting $300 OLED touch panel with a 3,200-by-2,000-pixel resolution is available as an option.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe XPS 14's memory- and storage-ceiling options are dense (64GB and 4TB respectively). Relatively speaking, so is the laptop's body, weighing 3.7 pounds (3.8 for OLED models), offsetting its trim size of 0.71 by 12.6 by 8.5 inches. By contrast, the HP Pavilion Plus 14 hits the scale at 3.04 pounds, and the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch qualifies as an ultraportable at 2.82 pounds.\n\nCrafted from CNC machined aluminum in either Graphite (black) or Platinum, the Dell exhibits almost no flex if you torque the screen corners or press the keyboard deck. What the company calls an InfinityEdge display has fashion-model-thin bezels, though I was dismayed that the webcam centered above the screen has neither a sliding privacy shutter nor a keyboard camera-kill command. The camera has IR face recognition, which coupled with a fingerprint-reader power button gives you two ways to skip typing passwords with Windows Hello.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nLike other Dell XPS notebooks, not to mention Apple Macbooks, the XPS 14 relies on USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports—two on the left edge and one on the right, the latter joined by an audio jack (shamefully missing from the Dell XPS 13) and a microSD card slot.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe laptop lacks USB Type-A and HDMI monitor ports, but you get one of each on a clever little dongle that, like the AC adapter, plugs into a USB-C port. You'll find no mobile broadband option here, but Intel Killer Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth come standard.\n\nUsing the Dell XPS 14: An Invisible Touchpad\n\nAs on the XPS 13 Plus, the XPS 14 keyboard is a voguish lattice, a rectangle sliced into flush-fitting squares instead of raised or separate keys. Even when its backlighting is turned off, the top row of LED icons is illuminated. Along with the Escape and Delete keys as well as volume and brightness controls, the row includes Home and End keys, though Page Up and Page Down are combinations of the Fn key and up and down cursor arrows. These arrow keys are sadly half-size keys stacked between full-size left and right arrows, in the awkward row instead of the proper inverted T that I always complain about in HP laptop reviews.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nDell's keyboard looks better than it feels: It's quiet and responsive but noticeably shallow and stiff. I make more than my usual amount of errors with these keys, and they would be uncomfortable to type on for hours. By contrast, the seamless glass touchpad was friendlier than I expected; it's placed so that muscle memory proves quite accurate for right-clicking (a tap at the bottom right), and it has a comfortable haptic click.\n\nThe webcam records in 1080p resolution and supports the recently added Windows Studio Effects for automatic framing, eye-contact adjustment, and background blurring. It's an above-average camera, capturing well-lit images even on a dark overcast day; we noted vivid color and no annoying noise or static.\n\nDell's entry-level IPS screen is impressively bright, with clean white backgrounds, though it doesn't tilt back quite as far as I'd like. The display's colors are rich and well-saturated, and it shows decently deep contrast and wide viewing angles. The screen's details are sharp with no pixelation around the edges of letters.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nPreinstalled on the system, the MyDell app works with the webcam to provide presence detection, locking and waking the PC as you walk away and return. This duo also protects your privacy by dimming the screen if you look away. MyDell also lets you fine-tune screen color tweaks such as gamma and temperature; choose optimized, quiet, or high-performance modes for cooling and fan noise; and launch a Killer networking dashboard to prioritize traffic for different apps and choose the strongest available Wi-Fi access point.\n\nOne more MyDell feature lets you toggle 3D audio effects and pick from equalizer profiles ranging from acoustic and jazz to metal and hip-hop. A set of 8-watt quad speakers pumps out loud but rather hollow audio. You'll hear a bit more bass than most laptops can muster, but drumbeats sound flat—at least it's easy to make out overlapping tracks.\n\nTesting the Dell XPS 14: Dedicated Graphics Don't Always Dazzle\n\nWhile the XPS 14 stands alone with a 14.5-inch display, you'll find plenty of 14-inch competitors on both sides of the 3-pound line that serves as our ultraportable cutoff. The Lenovo Slim 7i 14 Gen 9 and the Acer Swift Go 14 join the Dell in housing an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H CPU and a 1,920-by-1,200-pixel screen, though the Lenovo laptop has OLED instead of IPS tech. The abovementioned HP Pavilion Plus 14 and Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406) rely on AMD Ryzen instead of Intel processors.\n\nProductivity Tests\n\nWe run the same general productivity benchmarks across both mobile and desktop systems. Our first test is UL's PCMark 10, which simulates a variety of real-world productivity and office workflows to measure overall system performance and also includes a storage subtest for the primary drive.\n\nThree more benchmarks focus on the CPU, using all available cores and threads, to rate a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Maxon's Cinebench R23 uses that company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene, while Geekbench 5.5 Pro from Primate Labs simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning. We also use the open-source video transcoder HandBrake 1.4 to convert a 12-minute video clip from 4K to 1080p resolution (lower times are better).\n\nFinally, we run PugetBench for Photoshop by workstation maker Puget Systems, which uses the Creative Cloud version 22 of Adobe's famous image editor to rate a PC's performance for content creation and multimedia applications. It's an automated extension that executes a variety of general and GPU-accelerated Photoshop tasks ranging from opening, rotating, resizing, and saving an image to applying masks, gradient fills, and filters.\n\nAll five slimlines easily cleared the 4,000 points in PCMark 10, signaling excellent mainstream productivity for Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace. The XPS 14 performed well enough in our CPU tests and posted a competitive score in Photoshop; it's not meant for demanding workstation apps but is a fine choice as a daily driver.\n\nHowever, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch edged out the XPS 14 in several tests here, pointing toward competitive processing performance from AMD in this latest generation. Even more important, however, is that this Zenbook kept up with the XPS 14 for less than half the price at just $800 at the time of writing.\n\nGraphics Tests\n\nWe test each Windows PC's graphics with two DirectX 12 gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark, Night Raid (more modest, suitable for laptops with integrated graphics) and Time Spy (more demanding, suitable for gaming rigs with discrete GPUs).\n\nAdditionally, we run two tests from the cross-platform GPU benchmark GFXBench 5, which stresses both low-level routines like texturing and high-level, game-like image rendering. The 1440p Aztec Ruins and 1080p Car Chase tests are rendered offscreen to accommodate different display resolutions as well as exercise graphics and compute shaders using the OpenGL programming interface and hardware tessellation, respectively. The more frames per second (fps), the better.\n\nThe Dell's GeForce GPU predictably outran its rivals' integrated graphics in three of our four tests, though it laid down and died in Night Raid—a baffling lapse, since I tried the benchmark several times and configured Windows to use the RTX 4050 instead of Intel Arc Graphics. The others were hollow victories, with the XPS 14 underperforming by discrete-graphics standards, possibly because Dell's specs say the GPU is tuned to a tiny 30W.\n\nThis GPU wattage and performance weakens one of the Dell XPS 14's advantages as a nearly ultraportable laptop for creators. It should be enough to drive photo editing work, which might be this laptop's niche focus, but more intense visual work, like video editing and 3D content creation, would be better served by a higher-wattage chip.\n\nBattery and Display Tests\n\nWe test each laptop's battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie Tears of Steel) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%.

The Zenbook provides more-vivid color and contrast (with OLED versus IPS screen technology); it performs about as well, short of graphics tasks; it's about a pound lighter; and it costs $900 less. (Likewise, Asus fills the high-end ultraportable Editors' Choice slot with its still slightly cheaper Zenbook 14X OLED.)

        "text": "Dell's consumer flagship XPS laptops always flaunt an extra-fancy feature or two. (We're glad these days it's an LED touch-strip key row instead of a webcam aimed up your nose.) The new XPS 14 (model 9440, starting at $1,699; $2,099 as tested) shows off the flashy top row and seamless haptic touchpad that premiered in the Dell XPS 13 Plus, plus Intel's latest AI-enhanced silicon and Microsoft's dedicated key for AI-enhanced Windows Copilot. The Dell XPS 14 is a sleek and swift performer, but its only advantages over other slimline laptops are a barely larger 14.5-inch display and an optional discrete GPU for more content-creation performance. With that, the Asus Zenbook 14X OLED (UX3404) remains our Editors' Choice award holder for high-end ultraportable laptops, while Asus' own Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406) presents a similar experience for half the XPS 14's price.\n\nConfigurations and Design: Meteor Lake or Bust\n\nWhile Intel's Core Ultra 7 155H is the only processor choice you have at checkout, our review unit has the $400-extra 6GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 in place of the standard Intel Arc integrated graphics. Otherwise, this unit has base-model specs with 16GB of memory, a 512GB NVMe solid-state drive, Windows 11 Home, and an IPS screen with a 1,920-by-1,200-pixel resolution and variable 60Hz or 120Hz refresh rate (no touch control here). A tempting $300 OLED touch panel with a 3,200-by-2,000-pixel resolution is available as an option.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe XPS 14's memory- and storage-ceiling options are dense (64GB and 4TB respectively). Relatively speaking, so is the laptop's body, weighing 3.7 pounds (3.8 for OLED models), offsetting its trim size of 0.71 by 12.6 by 8.5 inches. By contrast, the HP Pavilion Plus 14 hits the scale at 3.04 pounds, and the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch qualifies as an ultraportable at 2.82 pounds.\n\nCrafted from CNC machined aluminum in either Graphite (black) or Platinum, the Dell exhibits almost no flex if you torque the screen corners or press the keyboard deck. What the company calls an InfinityEdge display has fashion-model-thin bezels, though I was dismayed that the webcam centered above the screen has neither a sliding privacy shutter nor a keyboard camera-kill command. The camera has IR face recognition, which coupled with a fingerprint-reader power button gives you two ways to skip typing passwords with Windows Hello.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nLike other Dell XPS notebooks, not to mention Apple Macbooks, the XPS 14 relies on USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports—two on the left edge and one on the right, the latter joined by an audio jack (shamefully missing from the Dell XPS 13) and a microSD card slot.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe laptop lacks USB Type-A and HDMI monitor ports, but you get one of each on a clever little dongle that, like the AC adapter, plugs into a USB-C port. You'll find no mobile broadband option here, but Intel Killer Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth come standard.\n\nUsing the Dell XPS 14: An Invisible Touchpad\n\nAs on the XPS 13 Plus, the XPS 14 keyboard is a voguish lattice, a rectangle sliced into flush-fitting squares instead of raised or separate keys. Even when its backlighting is turned off, the top row of LED icons is illuminated. Along with the Escape and Delete keys as well as volume and brightness controls, the row includes Home and End keys, though Page Up and Page Down are combinations of the Fn key and up and down cursor arrows. These arrow keys are sadly half-size keys stacked between full-size left and right arrows, in the awkward row instead of the proper inverted T that I always complain about in HP laptop reviews.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nDell's keyboard looks better than it feels: It's quiet and responsive but noticeably shallow and stiff. I make more than my usual amount of errors with these keys, and they would be uncomfortable to type on for hours. By contrast, the seamless glass touchpad was friendlier than I expected; it's placed so that muscle memory proves quite accurate for right-clicking (a tap at the bottom right), and it has a comfortable haptic click.\n\nThe webcam records in 1080p resolution and supports the recently added Windows Studio Effects for automatic framing, eye-contact adjustment, and background blurring. It's an above-average camera, capturing well-lit images even on a dark overcast day; we noted vivid color and no annoying noise or static.\n\nDell's entry-level IPS screen is impressively bright, with clean white backgrounds, though it doesn't tilt back quite as far as I'd like. The display's colors are rich and well-saturated, and it shows decently deep contrast and wide viewing angles. The screen's details are sharp with no pixelation around the edges of letters.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nPreinstalled on the system, the MyDell app works with the webcam to provide presence detection, locking and waking the PC as you walk away and return. This duo also protects your privacy by dimming the screen if you look away. MyDell also lets you fine-tune screen color tweaks such as gamma and temperature; choose optimized, quiet, or high-performance modes for cooling and fan noise; and launch a Killer networking dashboard to prioritize traffic for different apps and choose the strongest available Wi-Fi access point.\n\nOne more MyDell feature lets you toggle 3D audio effects and pick from equalizer profiles ranging from acoustic and jazz to metal and hip-hop. A set of 8-watt quad speakers pumps out loud but rather hollow audio. You'll hear a bit more bass than most laptops can muster, but drumbeats sound flat—at least it's easy to make out overlapping tracks.\n\nTesting the Dell XPS 14: Dedicated Graphics Don't Always Dazzle\n\nWhile the XPS 14 stands alone with a 14.5-inch display, you'll find plenty of 14-inch competitors on both sides of the 3-pound line that serves as our ultraportable cutoff. The Lenovo Slim 7i 14 Gen 9 and the Acer Swift Go 14 join the Dell in housing an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H CPU and a 1,920-by-1,200-pixel screen, though the Lenovo laptop has OLED instead of IPS tech. The abovementioned HP Pavilion Plus 14 and Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406) rely on AMD Ryzen instead of Intel processors.\n\nProductivity Tests\n\nWe run the same general productivity benchmarks across both mobile and desktop systems. Our first test is UL's PCMark 10, which simulates a variety of real-world productivity and office workflows to measure overall system performance and also includes a storage subtest for the primary drive.\n\nThree more benchmarks focus on the CPU, using all available cores and threads, to rate a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Maxon's Cinebench R23 uses that company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene, while Geekbench 5.5 Pro from Primate Labs simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning. We also use the open-source video transcoder HandBrake 1.4 to convert a 12-minute video clip from 4K to 1080p resolution (lower times are better).\n\nFinally, we run PugetBench for Photoshop by workstation maker Puget Systems, which uses the Creative Cloud version 22 of Adobe's famous image editor to rate a PC's performance for content creation and multimedia applications. It's an automated extension that executes a variety of general and GPU-accelerated Photoshop tasks ranging from opening, rotating, resizing, and saving an image to applying masks, gradient fills, and filters.\n\nAll five slimlines easily cleared the 4,000 points in PCMark 10, signaling excellent mainstream productivity for Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace. The XPS 14 performed well enough in our CPU tests and posted a competitive score in Photoshop; it's not meant for demanding workstation apps but is a fine choice as a daily driver.\n\nHowever, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch edged out the XPS 14 in several tests here, pointing toward competitive processing performance from AMD in this latest generation. Even more important, however, is that this Zenbook kept up with the XPS 14 for less than half the price at just $800 at the time of writing.\n\nGraphics Tests\n\nWe test each Windows PC's graphics with two DirectX 12 gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark, Night Raid (more modest, suitable for laptops with integrated graphics) and Time Spy (more demanding, suitable for gaming rigs with discrete GPUs).\n\nAdditionally, we run two tests from the cross-platform GPU benchmark GFXBench 5, which stresses both low-level routines like texturing and high-level, game-like image rendering. The 1440p Aztec Ruins and 1080p Car Chase tests are rendered offscreen to accommodate different display resolutions as well as exercise graphics and compute shaders using the OpenGL programming interface and hardware tessellation, respectively. The more frames per second (fps), the better.\n\nThe Dell's GeForce GPU predictably outran its rivals' integrated graphics in three of our four tests, though it laid down and died in Night Raid—a baffling lapse, since I tried the benchmark several times and configured Windows to use the RTX 4050 instead of Intel Arc Graphics. The others were hollow victories, with the XPS 14 underperforming by discrete-graphics standards, possibly because Dell's specs say the GPU is tuned to a tiny 30W.\n\nThis GPU wattage and performance weakens one of the Dell XPS 14's advantages as a nearly ultraportable laptop for creators. It should be enough to drive photo editing work, which might be this laptop's niche focus, but more intense visual work, like video editing and 3D content creation, would be better served by a higher-wattage chip.\n\nBattery and Display Tests\n\nWe test each laptop's battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie Tears of Steel) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test, with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off.\n\nTo gauge display performance, we also use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and its Windows software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation—what percentage of the sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show—and its 50% and peak brightness in nits (candelas per square meter).\n\nThe XPS almost tied the Zenbook for the win in our battery rundown, with more than enough stamina to get you through an all-day workday.

        "text": "The combination of an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H (Meteor Lake) CPU and Nvidia GTX 4050 graphics gives the Dell XPS 14 a lot of power, and the basic design certainly looks sleek with a rather flat keyboard, invisible touchpad, and function keys indicated by lights rather than physical keys. The model I tested had a wonderful 14.5-inch touch OLED display that looked great. All that power comes at a price, and the keyboard will attract some users, while turning others off.\n\nMeasuring 12.6 x 8.5 x 0.71 inches, the XPS 14 (9440) is just barely larger than the X1 Carbon Gen 12 and a bit smaller than the HP x360 Spectre 14. It looks good in CNC aluminum and is available in either a lighter platinum or a darker graphite shade; I used the former, and it looked quite good. The 14.5-inch display has very small bezels and is on a hinge that drops down, so you don’t see as much of the bezel as on other machines, with the hinge leaving room for air vents on the bottom of the unit. In short, it looks very modern.\n\nProbably because of the included discrete graphics, it’s heavier than the other machines I mentioned – my model, which had an OLED display, weighs 3.87 pounds (4.59 pounds with the included 100-watt charger), about 1.5 pounds more than the X1 Carbon. But it’s still rather sleek, and the weight is light compared to most machines with this level of graphics.\n\nAs mentioned, the keyboard will be controversial. It has a seamless glass touchpad, with haptic feedback and a Gorilla Glass cover. You don’t see the outlines of the touchpad area, but it reaches from the Windows key to the backspace, a larger area than on almost any laptop I’ve seen. Instead of traditional function key buttons, it has a capacitive touch function row, in which lights show you the various functions. All the essential keys are there, but since they don't change, I'm not quite sure about the benefit this offers for users. I wish it had indicator lights showing you when the speakers are muted. But it does allow for more cooling, which is important because of the graphics.\n\nThe backlit keyboard itself is flatter than I’m used to, but the keys are large with little room between them, and with 0.3mm travel, it’s an improvement from similar keyboards I’ve seen in the past. This is one of the first laptops I've used that has a dedicated physical Microsoft Copilot key, and that worked fine. Overall, the keyboard took a little getting used to, but I could touch type on it without difficulty.\n\nThe version of the XPS 14 I tested is based on the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H (Meteor Lake), which Dell says is running at 30 watts in this configuration. The 7 155H includes six \"performance\" cores, each capable of running two threads, and eight \"efficient\" cores on the main CPU tile, along with two additional \"low-power efficient\" cores on a separate tile. The performance cores have a base frequency of 1.4GHz and a maximum turbo of 4.8GHz. For graphics, the Intel processor has Intel Arc Graphics, which means eight Xe graphics cores; it includes Intel’s AI Boost with an NPU. Of course, if you want great graphics, you’ll use the internal Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050, which comes with 6 GB of GDDR6 memory and can run at up to 30 watts. Combined, the system can use up to 47 watts, with the power distributed, depending on the application. The system I tested came with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.\n\nThe combination yields good to great performance, depending on the application. On basic PC benchmarks, the XPS 14 did as well as any thin laptop I've tested; and on graphics performance, it unsurprisingly handily beats machines with integrated graphics, even those with the latest Intel chips. It's not as fast as the larger workstation machines like the ThinkPad P1 or the HP Zbook Studio 16 I tested last fall, but those are far bigger, far heavier machines. The XPS should do a far better job at graphics-intensive tasks like photo and video editing than most similar-sized machines.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nOn my toughest tests, the XPS 14 completed a video transcode in Handbrake in an hour and 18 minutes, ran a MatLab portfolio simulation in just under 33 minutes, and completed a large Excel model in 46 minutes, all in line with other Meteor Lake-based machines I tested. (Note that for Excel, older Raptor Lake-based systems seem faster, probably because of their faster clock speeds).\n\nIt really shined on the AI benchmarks I tried. On UL's Procyon AI inference test, the scores were in line with the other Meteor Lake systems when running with Windows ML or OpenVino; testing it with the Nvidia Tensor RT software made a huge difference, scoring more than twice as fast. In testing with a local installation of Spatial Diffusion, it created graphics in 6 or 7 seconds, compared with 3 or 4 minutes on the Meteor Lake machines with discrete graphics. If you intend to be running local AI models, that's a huge improvement.\n\nOne downside is battery life. On PCMark 10's Modern Office test, the XPS 14, which has a 70-watt-hour battery, lasted 9 hours and 18 minutes at 40 nits, and 8 hours and 38 minutes at 100 nits, both 2.5 to 3 hours less than the Meteor Lake systems with discrete graphics. Still, that's not bad.\n\nThe XPS line is available with both OLED and more traditional LCD displays. My unit had a 3200-by-2000-pixel resolution OLED with up to 400 nits of brightness a default showing text at 250%; it looked terrific. It comes with a 1080p FHD webcam that I thought looked very sharp, with nice colors.\n\nDell supports the basic Windows Studio Effects through the Camera app, including automatic framing, eye contact, and background effects. Unlike the recent HP and Lenovo systems I tested, Dell does not offer its own video enhancement software. I was surprised not to see any webcam shutter, though a light next to the camera does let you know when it’s on.\n\nThe camera supports Windows Hello, and with presence detection, so you can set the machine to lock when you step away from it and unlock as you approach. This is enabled through the MyDell application, which also includes such things as color calibration, 3D audio features, and the ability to remove background noise in audio. It supports Dolby Atmos and Waves MaxxAudio for 3D sound, plus has four speakers (two main and two tweeters). I thought the audio quality was quite good.\n\nThe XPS 14 has a limited variety of ports. The left side has two Thunderbolt/USB-C ports, while the right has another one, a microSD slot, and an audio jack. It’s convenient to be able to charge the machine through the USB-C ports on either the left or right, and the unit came with a USB-C dongle that supports both USB-A and HDMI, but for now, I prefer having HDMI and USB-A built-in.\n\nAs I write this, a similar model to my configuration (with the top-end Meteor Lake processor, Nvidia graphics, 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage) lists at $2,699 while a version without discrete graphics, non-touch LCD display, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage starts at $1,699. If you want the extra performance, you'll pay for it.\n\nIn summary, there's a lot to like about the XPS 14, with its modern look, very nice webcam, and great performance. There are tradeoffs—a keyboard that won't appeal to everyone, no webcam shutter, and weaker battery life than machines with integrated graphics. But if you're looking for discrete graphics in a smaller machine, or want to run AI models locally, the XPS 14 offers much to like.\n\nHere's PCMag's review of the similarly equipped Dell XPS 16 (9640).",

On PCMark 10's Modern Office test, the XPS 14, which has a 70-watt-hour battery, lasted 9 hours and 18 minutes at 40 nits, and 8 hours and 38 minutes at 100 nits, both 2.5 to 3 hours less than the Meteor Lake systems with discrete graphics. Still, that's not bad.\n\nThe XPS line is available with both OLED and more traditional LCD displays. My unit had a 3200-by-2000-pixel resolution OLED with up to 400 nits of brightness a default showing text at 250%; it looked terrific. It comes with a 1080p FHD webcam that I thought looked very sharp, with nice colors.\n\nDell supports the basic Windows Studio Effects through the Camera app, including automatic framing, eye contact, and background effects. Unlike the recent HP and Lenovo systems I tested, Dell does not offer its own video enhancement software. I was surprised not to see any webcam shutter, though a light next to the camera does let you know when it’s on.\n\nThe camera supports Windows Hello, and with presence detection, so you can set the machine to lock when you step away from it and unlock as you approach. This is enabled through the MyDell application, which also includes such things as color calibration, 3D audio features, and the ability to remove background noise in audio. It supports Dolby Atmos and Waves MaxxAudio for 3D sound, plus has four speakers (two main and two tweeters). I thought the audio quality was quite good.\n\nThe XPS 14 has a limited variety of ports. The left side has two Thunderbolt/USB-C ports, while the right has another one, a microSD slot, and an audio jack. It’s convenient to be able to charge the machine through the USB-C ports on either the left or right, and the unit came with a USB-C dongle that supports both USB-A and HDMI, but for now, I prefer having HDMI and USB-A built-in.\n\nAs I write this, a similar model to my configuration (with the top-end Meteor Lake processor, Nvidia graphics, 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage) lists at $2,699 while a version without discrete graphics, non-touch LCD display, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage starts at $1,699. If you want the extra performance, you'll pay for it.\n\nIn summary, there's a lot to like about the XPS 14, with its modern look, very nice webcam, and great performance. There are tradeoffs—a keyboard that won't appeal to everyone, no webcam shutter, and weaker battery life than machines with integrated graphics. But if you're looking for discrete graphics in a smaller machine, or want to run AI models locally, the XPS 14 offers much to like.\n\nHere's PCMag's review of the similarly equipped Dell XPS 16 (9640).",
        "summary": "The combination of an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H (Meteor Lake) CPU and Nvidia GTX 4050 graphics gives the Dell XPS 14 a lot of power, and the basic design certainly looks sleek with a rather flat keyboard, invisible touchpad, and function keys indicated by lights rather than physical keys. The model I tested had a wonderful 14.5-inch touch OLED display that looked great. All that power comes at a price, and the keyboard will attract some users, while turning others off. As mentioned, the keyboard will be controversial. It has a seamless glass touchpad, with haptic feedback and a Gorilla Glass cover. The combination yields good to great performance, depending on the application. In testing with a local installation of Spatial Diffusion, it created graphics in 6 or 7 seconds, compared with 3 or 4 minutes on the Meteor Lake machines with discrete graphics. On PCMark 10's Modern Office test, the XPS 14, which has a 70-watt-hour battery, lasted 9 hours and 18 minutes at 40 nits, and 8 hours and 38 minutes at 100 nits, both 2.5 to 3 hours less than the Meteor Lake systems with discrete graphics.

        "text": "The next-generation Nvidia Blackwell GPU architecture and RTX 50-series GPUs are coming, right on schedule. While Nvidia hasn't officially provided any timeframe for when the consumer parts will be announced, there have been plenty of rumors and supposed leaks of data. We've spoken with some people as well, and the expectation is that we'll see at least the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 by the time the holiday season kicks off in October or November. Blackwell GPUs will then join the ranks of the best graphics cards.\n\n\n\nNvidia has also provided many of the core details for its data center Blackwell B200 GPU. While the AI and data center variants will inevitably differ, there are some shared aspects between past consumer and data center Nvidia GPUs, and we expect that to continue. That means that we at least have some good indications of certain aspects of the future RTX 50-series GPUs.\n\n\n\nThere are still a lot of unknowns, with leaks that appear more like people throwing darts at the wall instead of having actual inside information. We'll cover the main rumors along with other details, including the release date, potential specifications, and other technology. Over the coming months, we can expect additional details to come out, and we'll be updating this article as information becomes available. Here's everything we know about Nvidia Blackwell and the RTX 50-series GPUs.\n\nOf all the unknowns, the release date — at least for the first Blackwell GPUs — is the easiest to pin down. Based on what we've personally heard, we expect the RTX 50-series to launch by the end of the year. Nvidia tends to be good on timing new GPU releases, and getting the top RTX 5090 and 5080 out before the November and December holiday shopping period makes the most sense.\n\n\n\nThere's plenty of historical precedent here as well. The Ada Lovelace RTX 40-series GPUs first appeared in October 2022. The Ampere RTX 30-series GPUs first appeared in September 2020. Prior to that, RTX 20-series launched two years earlier in September 2018, and the GTX 10-series was in May/June 2016, with the GTX 900-series arriving in September 2014. That's a full decade of new Nvidia GPU architectures arriving approximately every two years, and we see no reason for Nvidia to change tactics now.\n\n\n\nIt's not just about the two-year consumer GPU cadence, either. Nvidia first revealed core details of the Hopper H100 architecture in March 2022 at its annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC), with Ada Lovelace arriving in October 2024. And in May 2020, it first revealed its Ampere A100 architecture, followed by the consumer variants a few months later. The same thing happened in 2018 as well, with Volta V100 and Turing, and in 2016 there was the Tesla P100 and Pascal. So, in the past four generations, we've learned first about the data center and AI GPUs, with the consumer GPUs revealed and launched later in the same year. Now, Nvidia just revealed the Blackwell B200 architecture, again at GTC, and it's a safe bet we'll hear about the consumer variants this fall.\n\n\n\nWe don't know the exact names or models Nvidia plans for the next generation Blackwell parts. We're confident we'll have RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070, and RTX 5060 cards, and probably some combination of Ti and/or Super variants. Some of those variants will undoubtedly come out during the mid-cycle refresh in late 2025 or early 2026. We're also curious about whether or not Nvidia will have an RTX 5050 GPU — it skipped that level on desktops with the 40-series and 20-series, though the latter had the GTX 1660 and 1650 class GPUs.\n\n\n\nGiven the past patterns, we expect at least the top-tier RTX 5090 and 5080 to arrive this year, perhaps with an RTX 5070 Ti to keep them company. Or maybe Nvidia will have the RTX 5090, RTX 5080 Ti, and RTX 5080 launch this year. The mid-tier (based on the model numbers) 5070 and 5060 GPUs will then follow, most likely sometime in 2025, with the typical staggered release schedule.\n\nTSMC 4NP, refined 4nm Nvidia\n\nNvidia's B200 chips will use TSMC 4NP (Image credit: Nvidia)\n\nOne of the surprising announcements at GTC 2024 was that Blackwell B200 will use the TSMC 4NP node — \"4nm Nvidia Performance.\" While it's certainly true that many process names have become largely detached from physical characteristics, many expected Nvidia to move to a refined variant of TSMC's cutting-edge N3 process technology. Instead, it opted for a refinement of the existing 4N node that's already been used with Hopper and Ada Lovelace GPUs for the past two years.\n\n\n\nGoing this route certainly offers some cost savings, though TSMC doesn't disclose the contract pricing agreements with its various partners. Blackwell B200 also uses a dual-chip solution, with the two identical chips linked via a 10 TB/s NV-HBI (Nvidia High Bandwidth Interface) connection. Perhaps Nvidia just didn't think it needed to move to a 3nm-class node for this generation.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, that opens the door for AMD and even Intel to potentially shift to a newer and more advanced process node, cramming more transistors into a smaller chip. Nvidia took a similar approach with the RTX 30-series, using a less expensive Samsung 8N process instead of the newer and better TSMC N7. It will be interesting to see if this has any major impact on how the various next-generation GPUs stack up.\n\n\n\nOf course, it's also possible that Blackwell B200 variants will use TSMC 4NP, while consumer chips use a different node. Much of that depends on how much of the core architecture gets shared between the data center and consumer variants and whether Nvidia thinks it's beneficial to diversify. There's precedent here for having different nodes and even manufacturers, as Ampere A100 used TSMC N7 while the RTX 30-series chips used Samsung 8N. GTX 10-series Pascal GP107 and GP108 were also made on Samsung's 14LPP, while GP102, GP104, and GP106 were made on TSMC 16FF.\n\nNext generation GDDR7 memory\n\nGDDR7 chips were shown at GTC 2024 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\n\nIt's long been expected that the consumer and professional (i.e., not strictly data center) Blackwell GPUs will move to GDDR7 memory. All indications from GTC 2024 are that GDDR7 will be ready in time for the next generation of GPUs before the end of the year. In fact, Samsung and SK hynix showed off GDDR7 chips at GTC, and Micron confirmed that GDDR7 is also in production.\n\n\n\nThe current generation RTX 40-series GPUs use GDDR6X and GDDR6 memory, clocked at anywhere from 17Gbps to 23Gbps. GDDR7 has target speeds of up to 36Gbps, 50% higher than GDDR6X and 80% higher than vanilla GDDR6. SK hynix says it will even have 40Gbps chips, though the exact timeline for when those might be available wasn't detailed. Regardless, this will provide a much-needed boost to memory bandwidth at all levels.\n\n\n\nOf course, we don't know if Nvidia will actually ship cards with memory clocked at 36Gbps. In the past, it used 24Gbps GDDR6X chips but clocked them at 22.4Gbps or 23Gbps—and some 24Gbps Micron chips were apparently down-binned to 21Gbps in the various RTX 4090 graphics cards that we tested. So, Nvidia could take 36Gbps memory but only run it at 32Gbps. That's still a healthy bump to bandwidth.\n\n\n\nAt 36Gbps, a 384-bit GDDR7 memory interface can provide 1728 GB/s of bandwidth. That's 71% higher than what we currently get on the RTX 4090. A 256-bit interface would deliver 1152 GB/s, compared to the 4080 Super's 736 GB/s — a 57% increase. 192-bit cards would have 864 GB/s, and even 128-bit cards would get up to 576 GB/s of raw bandwidth. Nvidia might even go so far as to create a 96-bit interface with 432 GB/s of bandwidth.\n\n\n\nWe also expect that Nvidia will keep using a large L2 cache with Blackwell. This will provide even more effective memory bandwidth — every cache hit means a memory access that doesn't need to happen. With a 50% cache hit rate as an example, that would double the effective memory bandwidth, though note that hit rates vary by game and settings, with higher resolutions in particular reducing the hit rate.\n\n\n\nGDDR7 also potentially addresses the issue of memory capacity versus interface width. At GTC, we were told that 16Gb chips (2GB) are in production, but 24Gb (3GB) chips are also coming. The larger chips with non-power-of-two capacity probably won't be ready until 2025, but those will be more important for lower-tier parts. There's no pressing need for consumer graphics cards to have more than 24GB of memory, though we could see a 32GB RTX 5090 (with a 512-bit interface). Even 16GB is generally sufficient for gaming, with a 256-bit interface.\n\n\n\nHowever, the availability of 24Gb chips means Nvidia (along with AMD and Intel) could put 18GB of VRAM on a 192-bit interface, 12GB on a 128-bit interface, and 9GB on a 96-bit interface. We could even see 24GB cards with a 256-bit interface, and 36GB on a 384-bit interface — and double that capacity for professional cards. Or how about a 512-bit interface on a professional card with 'clamshell' memory (chips on both sides of the PCB), packing a whopping 96GB of VRAM? That would be excellent for certain AI and professional workloads, and it's more likely a case of \"when\" rather than \"if\" we'll see such a card.\n\nThe Blackwell architecture will almost certainly contain various updates and enhancements over the previous generation Ada Lovelace architecture, but right now the summary of what we know for certain can be summed up with two words: not much. But every generation of Nvidia GPUs has contained at least a few architectural upgrades, and we can expect the same to occur this round.\n\n\n\nNvidia has increased the potential ray tracing performance in every RTX generation, and Blackwell seems likely to continue that trend. With more games like Alan Wake 2 and Cyberpunk 2077 pushing full path tracing — not to mention the potential for modders to use RTX Remix to enhance older DX10-era games with full path tracing — there's even more need for higher ray tracing throughput. There will probably be other RT-centric updates as well, just like Ada offered SER (Shader Execution Reordering), OMM (Opacity Micro-Maps), and DMM (Displaced Micro-Meshes). But what those changes might be is as yet unknown.\n\n\n\nWhat we do know is that the data center Blackwell B200 GPU has reworked the tensor cores yet again, offering native support for FP4 and FP6 numerical formats. Those will be primarily useful for AI inference, and considering the consumer GPUs will do double duty with the professional cards, it's a safe bet that all Blackwell chips will support FP4 and FP6 as well. (Ada added FP8 support to its tensor cores, as a related example.)\n\n\n\nWhat other architectural changes might Blackwell bring? If we're correct that Nvidia is sticking with TSMC 4NP for the consumer parts, we wouldn't anticipate massive alterations. There will still be a large L2 cache, and the enhanced OFA (Optical Flow Accelerator) used for DLSS 3 frame generation will still be present. It might even get some tweaks to improve it, though we'll have to wait and see.\n\n\n\nOne potential hint at what could happen with the fastest solutions comes from the Blackwell B200. Nvidia created NV-HBI to link two identical chips together into one massive GPU. This isn't SLI but rather a chiplet-style approach with massive inter-chip bandwidth so that the two chips functionally behave as a single GPU. Could NV-HBI show up on consumer GPUs as well? We think that's a reasonable possibility — probably not on the lower-spec chips but certainly on the largest chip.\n\n\n\nRaw compute, for both graphics and more general workloads, will almost certainly increase by a decent amount, though probably more along the lines of a 30% boost rather than a 50% increase. RTX 4080 offers 40 TeraFLOPS of FP32 compute compared to the 3080's 30 TeraFLOPS, for example — a 33% increase — while the 4090 offers 83 TeraFLOPS compared to the 3090's 40 TeraFLOPS — a much larger 107% increase. Perhaps Nvidia will \"go big\" on the RTX 5090 as well while making smaller improvements elsewhere, but we'll have to wait and see.\n\nRTX 50-Series Pricing\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nHow much will the RTX 50-series GPUs cost? Frankly, considering the current market conditions, there's little reason to expect Nvidia to reduce prices relative to the current RTX 40-series GPUs. Nvidia will price the cards as high as it feels the market will accept. With potentially higher AI performance and the increased demand from the non-gaming sector, we might be lucky if the next generation carries the same pricing structure as the current generation.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, we hope that generational pricing won't increase. $1,000 for the \"step down\" RTX 4080 Super means that particular level of GPU now costs 43% more than it did in the RTX 2080 Super days. Of course, we also had the \"$699\" RTX 3080 10GB and \"$1,199\" RTX 3080 Ti in between, when prices were all kinds of messed up thanks to the prevalence of GPU cryptomining coupled with the effects of Covid-19. Thankfully, while it's currently technically profitable to mine certain cryptocurrencies with a GPU, WhatToMine puts the estimated income at less than $1 per day for an RTX 4090 — meaning it would take about five years to break even at current rates and prices.\n\n\n\nThe budget GPU sector has also basically died off. Integrated graphics have reached the point where they're \"fast enough\" for most common workloads, even including modest gaming — that's particularly true for mobile processors, with desktop options typically being far less potent. The last new GPUs to truly target the budget sector were AMD's rather unimpressive RX 6500 XT and RX 6400 — Nvidia hasn't made a new sub-$200 GPU since the GTX 1650 Super launched in 2019 (unless you want to count the travesty that was the GTX 1630).\n\n\n\nThat means for dedicated desktop graphics cards we're now living in a world where \"budget\" means around $300, \"mainstream\" means $400–$600, \"high-end\" is for GPUs costing close to $1,000, and the \"enthusiast\" segment targets $1,500 or more. Or at least, that appears to be Nvidia's take on the situation. AMD's GPUs tend to be a bit more affordable, particularly when looking at street prices, but Nvidia has maintained a higher pricing structure for at least the past four years.\n\nBlackwell speculative specifications\n\nGiven everything we've said so far, it should hopefully be clear that there's very little official information on Blackwell currently available. The Nvidia hack in 2022 gave us the Blackwell name and some potential codenames, but that was over two years ago, and a lot can change in that time. Plus, the details on Blackwell were pretty thin in the first place.\n\n\n\nHowever, as with every major GPU architecture update, plenty of rumors and supposed leaks are floating around. Some suggest they have inside knowledge, others appear to be guesses. Just to cite a few recent examples, one 'leak' said we should expect Blackwell GB202 to have a 384-bit memory interface in November 2023, while a more recent leak in March 2024 says Blackwell GB202 will have a 512-bit interface.\n\n\n\nSomething else to chew on is the NV-HBI dual-chip solution for the Blackwell B200 that we mentioned earlier. Perhaps the top-tier Blackwell GB202 will take the same approach and have two GB203 chips linked via NV-HBI. That would allow Nvidia to keep the actual die size of the fastest chips in check while simultaneously providing for much higher levels of performance.\n\n\n\nWe'll include both potential variants of GB202 in our speculative specs table for now, along with estimated names and specs elsewhere. The large number of question marks should make it clear that we do not have any hard information at present.\n\nStay on the Cutting Edge Join the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC tech news — and have for over 25 years.

Launch Price $1,999? $1,599? $999? $599? $449? $299?\n\nAgain, take the above information with a massive helping of salt — seriously, just dump out the whole salt shaker! We've basically made up some numbers that seem plausible and stuffed them into the usual Nvidia formula with a given number of SMs, which then gives the CUDA, RT, and tensor core counts based on the usual 128 CUDA, 1 RT, and 4 tensor cores per SM. There are also (traditionally) four TMUs (Texture Mapping Units) per SM. Nvidia can slightly tweak the SM count quite easily, so final specs may not be nailed down until a few months before launch.\n\n\n\nA lot of the potential specs are basically placeholders using whatever Nvidia currently has with the RTX 40-series cards. This mostly applies to L2 cache size, ROPs (Render Outputs), power requirements, and pricing, for example. We make no claims to have insider knowledge of the actual specs right now, and as far as we're aware, no one reputable has leaked core counts either.\n\n\n\nFor the time being, clock speed estimates are a static 2.5 GHz on the GPU clock and 36Gbps on the GDDR7 clock. Let's also note that Nvidia could mix things up and continue to use GDDR6X on certain GPUs within the product stack, though we're really hoping to see 3GB chips on all the GPUs with a 192-bit or narrower memory interface.\n\n\n\nWe'll update the above table over the coming months and even years as the rumors develop, and eventually, we'll have official part names and specifications. We'll almost certainly end up with far more than five different graphics cards as well, but there's no sense in guesstimating where those might land at present. Just note that there are ten different RTX 40-series desktop GPUs and twelve different RTX 30-series desktop variants (counting the 3060 12GB / 8GB and 3050 8GB / 6GB as different models).\n\nThe future GPU landscape\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nNvidia won't be the only game in town for next-generation graphics cards. There's plenty of evidence to suggest we'll see Intel's Battlemage release this fall as well, and AMD RDNA 4 will also arrive at some point—maybe not this year, but we'd expect to see it in early 2025 at the latest. (We'll have more detailed articles on both of those, hopefully in the near future, so stay tuned.)\n\n\n\nBut while there will certainly be competition, Nvidia has dominated the GPU landscape for the past decade. At present, the Steam Hardware Survey indicates Nvidia has 78% of the graphics card market, AMD sits at 14.6%, and Intel accounts for just 7.2% (with 0.12% \"other\"). That doesn't even tell the full story, however.\n\n\n\nBoth AMD and Intel make integrated graphics, and it's a safe bet that a large percentage of their respective market shares comes from laptops and desktops that lack a dedicated GPU. AMD's highest market share for what is clearly a dedicated GPU comes from the RX 580, sitting at #31 with 0.81%. Intel doesn't even have a dedicated GPU listed in the survey. For the past three generations of AMD and Nvidia dedicated GPUs, the Steam survey suggests Nvidia has 92.6% of the market compared to 7.4% for AMD. Granted, the details of how Valve collects data are obtuse, at best, and AMD may be doing better than the survey suggests. Still, it's a green wave of Nvidia cards at the top of the charts.\n\n\n\nWhat we've heard from Intel suggests it intends for Battlemage to compete more in the mainstream and budget portions of the graphics space. And by that, we mean in the $200 to perhaps $600 price range. However, Intel hasn't said much lately, so that could have changed. AMD definitely competes better with Nvidia for the time being, both in performance and drivers and efficiency, but we're still waiting for its GPUs to experience their \"Ryzen moment\" — GPU chiplets so far haven't proven an amazing success.\n\n\n\nCurrently, Nvidia delivers higher overall performance, and much higher ray tracing performance. It also dominates in the AI space, with related technologies like DLSS — including DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction — Broadcast, and other features. It's currently Nvidia's race to lose, and it will take a lot of effort for AMD and Intel to close the gap and gain significant market share, at least outside of the integrated graphics arena. On the other hand, high Nvidia prices and a heavier focus on AI for the non-gaming market could leave room for its competitors. We'll see where the chips land later this year.",

However, as with every major GPU architecture update, plenty of rumors and supposed leaks are floating around. Some suggest they have inside knowledge, others appear to be guesses. Perhaps the top-tier Blackwell GB202 will take the same approach and have two GB203 chips linked via NV-HBI. We'll include both potential variants of GB202 in our speculative specs table for now, along with estimated names and specs elsewhere.

Architecture GB202 (2x GB203) GB202 GB203 GB205 GB206 GB207 Process Technology TSMC 4NP? There are also (traditionally) four TMUs (Texture Mapping Units) per SM. For the time being, clock speed estimates are a static 2.5 GHz on the GPU clock and 36Gbps on the GDDR7 clock. Let's also note that Nvidia could mix things up and continue to use GDDR6X on certain GPUs within the product stack, though we're really hoping to see 3GB chips on all the GPUs with a 192-bit or narrower memory interface. We'll have more detailed articles on both of those, hopefully in the near future, so stay tuned.) That doesn't even tell the full story, however. Intel doesn't even have a dedicated GPU listed in the survey. However, Intel hasn't said much lately, so that could have changed. On the other hand, high Nvidia prices and a heavier focus on AI for the non-gaming market could leave room for its competitors."

        "text": "Dow Jones futures will open Sunday evening, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, following a tough market week. Earnings from Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META) and many more are on deck. Tesla, which reports Tuesday, slashed EV and FSD prices over the weekend.\n\nX\n\nThe stock market suffered sharp losses in the past week. The Dow Jones actually rose a fraction. But the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite plunged below their respective 50-day moving averages, suffering their worst week in more than a year.\n\nMost of all, leading stocks were the biggest losers. Nvidia (NVDA), the ultimate AI stock and company, dived below key support.\n\nChip and AI stocks sold off on cautious comments from ASML (ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM).\n\nAI server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) crashed Friday after not releasing preliminary results, raising fears about AI demand overall.\n\nThe market environment is decidedly weak. Investors should be largely in cash, waiting for renewed signs of strength in the major indexes and leading stocks.\n\nKey Earnings Ahead\n\nMicrosoft, Meta Platforms, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) headline a huge week of earnings. General Electric (GE), ServiceNow (NOW), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Dexcom (DXCM) and Caterpillar (CAT) are among the many other notable reports on tap.\n\nGoogle stock is in a buy zone. Meta stock, Chipotle and Caterpillar could be setting up, while Dexcom has retreated slightly below a buy point. GE is greatly extended while Microsoft and ServiceNow are starting to crack. Tesla stock has plunged to 52-week lows amid a host of bad news.\n\nThese reports and guidance will have a huge impact on their sectors and overall market. Microsoft, Google, Meta and ServiceNow will offer insights into artificial intelligence, as well as cloud computing, online advertising and business software.\n\nFor Tesla, there are huge questions regarding the EV giant's growth strategy. Most of all, is Elon Musk shelving a next-generation Model 2?\n\nOn Saturday, Tesla cut Model Y, S and X prices in the U.S. by $2,000, while also cutting Full Self-Driving to $8,000 from $12,000.\n\nOn Sunday, Tesla cut China prices for the Model 3 and Y by nearly $2,000 while slashing Model S and X prices by up to 22%. Tesla also cut Model 3 prices in key European markets by roughly $2,100-$3,200.\n\nMeta stock is on IBD Leaderboard. Microsoft stock is on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list. Meta, DexCom and Google stock are on the IBD 50. Meta Platforms, Google and ServiceNow stock are on the IBD Big Cap 20.\n\nDow Jones Futures Today\n\nDow Jones futures open at 6 p.m. ET, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures.\n\nRemember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.\n\nJoin IBD experts as they analyze leading stocks and the market on IBD Live\n\nStock Market Suffers Big Losses\n\nThe stock market suffered heavy losses this past week, especially the Nasdaq and leading growth plays.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.01% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index tumbled 3.05%, its biggest weekly decline since March 2023. The Nasdaq composite plunged 5.5%, its worst week since November 2022. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 2.8%.\n\nThe market's power trend, in force since November, is over as the Nasdaq's 21-day exponential moving average undercut the 50-day line.\n\nSome stocks are holding support, with a few making encouraging moves. But generally leading stocks are looking damaged or broken.\n\nAI and chip stocks had been holding up reasonably well. But they led the downside this past week, with Nvidia and especially Super Micro plunging on Friday.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility index, or VIX, briefly spiked Friday to the market fear gauge's highest levels since late October. Meanwhile, various indicators suggest the market is significantly oversold. But it's been oversold for some time.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield jumped 11 basis points to 4.61%, hitting a five-month intraday high of nearly 4.7% on Tuesday. Markets now expect just one Fed rate cut in 2024.\n\nU.S. crude oil futures fell 2.9% to $83.14 a barrel for the week.\n\nTesla Plunges With One Big Question For The Earnings Call\n\nETFs\n\nAmong growth ETFs, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) plunged 5.1%. Microsoft is a huge IGV holding, with ServiceNow stock a key component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) dived 9.7%. Nvidia stock is the No. 1 holding in SMH, with Taiwan Semi and ASML key members.\n\nSPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) dipped 0.8% last week. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) retreated 2.8%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) jumped 4.7%. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) skidded 3.9%.\n\nThe Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) fell 1.25% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) closed fractionally higher. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) gave up 2%, with Caterpillar and GE stock the top two holdings.\n\nThe Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) advanced 0.85% and the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) climbed 1.8%.\n\nReflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) sold off 9.6% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 10%. Tesla stock is a huge holding across Ark Invest's ETFs.\n\nTime The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nAI Hardware Stocks Plunge\n\nAI chip and hardware stocks, the driving force of the market rally from late October to early March, were the big losers last week.\n\nASML plunged 10.6% for the week on weak Q1 sales and guidance. That also dragged down other chip-equipment makers.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor stock dived 10.4% despite beating views and guiding higher, fueled by AI chip demand. But the foundry giant was cautious about demand for chips overall.\n\nNvidia tumbled 13.6%, including Friday's 10% dive to knife through the 50-day. It's now given up over two-thirds of its gains following the fiscal Q1 earnings on Feb. 21.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) crashed 31% for the week\n\nSMCI stock dived 20.6% for the week even with Tuesday's 10.6% spike. Shares dived 23.1% on Friday, literally on no news. Disappointing investors, Super Micro didn't give preliminary results as the AI server maker announced its upcoming Q1 earnings date. That might have also raised concerns about AI chip demand.\n\nAll of these stocks flashed sell signals.\n\nSMCI and Nvidia are the two biggest winners on the S&P 500 in 2024, but they were the S&P 500's biggest losers Friday.\n\nCatch The Next Big Winning Stock With MarketSurge\n\nWhat To Do Now\n\nThe stock market is in bad shape. The major indexes are all well below their 50-day moving averages. Nvidia and other tech standouts are no longer resisting the selling but instead starting to lead the slide.\n\nIt's not a time to be buying stocks. Investors should have slim-to-modest exposure, generally only keeping winners with a hefty cushion.\n\nThis is a time to build watchlists. You want to look for stocks finding support and showing relative strength.\n\nThere are some names holding up, including GE, Google, Meta, Chipotle, Glaukos (GKOS), Martin Marietta (MLM) and Allstate (ALL).\n\nRemember that in a downtrend, resilient stocks today may not stay that way tomorrow, as Nvidia, Super Micro and ServiceNow showed.\n\nAnd relative winners can be absolute losers.\n\nEarnings season could provide a positive catalyst for stocks. But, as investors saw this past week, they could trigger fresh selling.\n\nRead The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.\n\nPlease follow Ed Carson on Threads at @edcarson1971 and X/Twitter at @IBD_ECarson for stock market updates and more.\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:\n\nWhy This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks\n\nWant To Get Quick Profits And Avoid Big Losses?

        "text": "In this article MS\n\nNOVO.B-DK\n\nLLY Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nA food delivery messenger carries a take out bag outside aSweetgreen in Manhattan on September 14, 2023. Jeenah Moon | The Washington Post | Getty Images\n\nA highly popular group of weight loss and diabetes drugs is decreasing some consumers' appetites — and also how much they spend on food. Most people taking those medications, called GLP-1s, say they are spending less on eating out at restaurants and ordering takeout, according to a Morgan Stanley survey released on Tuesday. A smaller share of those surveyed say they are tightening their purse strings in the grocery store. The findings add to the mounting concerns that soaring demand for GLP-1s could take a bite out of the bottom lines of some of the biggest restaurant companies and makers of packaged snacks like Doritos, Oreos and Hershey's Kisses. GLP-1s include Novo Nordisk 's blockbuster weight loss injection Wegovy and diabetes counterpart Ozempic, along with Eli Lilly 's popular weight loss treatment Zepbound and diabetes injection Mounjaro. The rising demand for these four drugs isn't expected to ease anytime soon. In the new survey, Morgan Stanley analysts said they expect the market for GLP-1s to be worth $105 billion by 2030. They also estimate that 31.5 million people, or around 9% of the U.S. population, will take GLP-1s by 2035. \"There is growing evidence that the drugs have a meaningful impact on consumer behavior and spending on groceries and restaurants,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said in the survey. \"All of these dynamics suggest GLP-1 drugs' impact across consumer sectors is set to increase as drug uptake grows and the drugs reshape behavior among a demographic group that represents a disproportionate share of calorie consumption.\"\n\nBoxes of Wegovy made by Novo Nordisk are seen at a pharmacy in London, Britain March 8, 2024. Hollie Adams | Reuters\n\nMorgan Stanley conducted the survey of 300 consumers who are currently taking GLP-1 drugs in February. Those people are \"early in their weight loss journey,\" but are making substantial changes to their diets and spending, according to the firm. When asked to gauge how their monthly spending on eating out at restaurants has changed since starting a GLP-1, 63% of the consumers said they are spending less, 28% said they are spending about the same amount, and 9% said they are spending more. Meanwhile, 61% said they are spending less on deliveries or takeout from restaurants, 31% said they are spending around the same amount and 8% said they are spending more. Fewer participants said they lowered their grocery spending since they started a GLP-1: 31% said they are spending less, 46% said they are spending around the same amount and 23% said they are spending more. The survey also found that people tended to stick with the same restaurant but changed the kinds of meals they ordered. When asked whether they finish less of the food they order in one sitting when dining out, 42% of participants said \"always\" or \"most of the time,\" and 44% said \"occasionally.\" Forty-one percent said they are \"always\" or \"most of the time\" ordering smaller portions of food overall, while 43% said they are only sometimes doing that. Consumers in the survey reported reduced food consumption across the board, but the difference is most notable on snacks, confections, carbonated and sugary drinks and alcohol, according to the Morgan Stanley survery. Roughly half of people reported cutting consumption of regular sodas, alcohol and salty snacks by 50% or more since starting on weight loss drugs. Twenty-two percent reported stopping alcohol consumption entirely.",

Be attentive to the fine details, including how a company works through a backlog and how much money it devotes toward infrastructure.\n\nWhen it comes to chip stocks, Schleif also recommends taking a look at government grants. The industry won big in 2022 when President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law. The measure allocated funds toward building out semiconductor production on U.S. soil.\n\nSamsung Electronics is in line to receive funding from CHIPS for making semiconductors in Texas, while Intel has been awarded up to $8.5 billion from the measure.\n\n\"Focus on the underlying fundamentals, and are they moving in the right direction, [rather] than just last quarter's earnings,\" Schleif advised.\n\nInvestors should also avoid blindly chasing the hot winners that have benefited from AI enthusiasm. For Laffer Tengler Investments CEO and CIO Nancy Tengler, that means looking at some of the old-economy stocks embracing the new digital wave. She likes Microsoft and IBM , a pair of tech industry veterans.\n\nWhen building any portfolio, financial advisors and portfolio managers stress the importance of diversification — and the same applies to AI.\n\nAn exchange-traded fund might be a good way to get that diversified exposure to a basket of stocks that could benefit from the AI theme, rather than sticking with one or two promising names.\n\nConsider diversifying through ETFs\n\nSelecting ETFs that incorporate dozens of names can be a lower-risk way to diversify, said Marguerita Cheng, a certified financial planner and CEO of Blue Ocean Global Wealth in Gaithersburg, Maryland.\n\nShe highlighted the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) , the First Trust Nasdaq AI and Robotics ETF (ROBT) and the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ).\n\n\"That's one way to get some exposure without putting the proverbial all the eggs in that one basket,\" said BMO's Schleif. \"You want to be able to focus on a few different avenues such that you can withstand the volatility.\"",
        "summary": "Artificial intelligence has shaken up the investing landscape since the groundbreaking launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. Since then, investors have poured money into all things related to AI as they hunt for the next big winners. Those tail winds continued into 2024, but even the winners eventually reach their limit. Indeed, some of this year's highest fliers came down to earth on Friday, with Big Tech names dragging down the Nasdaq Composite by more than 2%. What to look for\n\nThere's no secret formula to investing and picking artificial intelligence stocks, but investors can keep an eye on certain metrics and trends when weeding out the winners from the duds. When it comes to chip stocks, Schleif also recommends taking a look at government grants."

        "text": "Gold-bug Peter Schiff fully admits he would ‘be a lot richer’ had he invested all his money in the ‘Magnificent 7’ a decade ago\n\nGold-bug Peter Schiff has admitted he could have made a lot more money over the last decade if he had focused his investing on high-performing stocks instead of gold.\n\n“Had I had all my money 10 years ago in the ‘Magnificent Seven,’ I’d be a lot richer than I am today,” the 61-year-old investor said recently on the PBD Podcast.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger\n\nCost-of-living in America is still out of control — use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says\n\nThese 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 — and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\n“I mean, I’m rich enough, but I would have more money had I concentrated on those names,” Schiff added — referring to the seven giants dominating the U.S. stock market: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA) and Meta (META).\n\nHere’s why U.S. stock investors saw their wealth explode in the last decade — and why Schiff still cautions against being overweight equities.\n\nTop 1% rake in huge gains\n\nThe total net worth of the wealthiest 1% in the U.S. hit $44.6 trillion at the end of 2023, according to Federal Reserve data — a new record driven primarily by an end-of-year stock rally that boosted rich individuals’ investment portfolios.\n\nThat new wealth record marks an almost 50% jump from the first quarter of 2020, when the total net worth of the top 1% was $30.1 trillion.\n\nRead more: 'Baby boomers bust': Robert Kiyosaki warns that older Americans will get crushed in the 'biggest bubble in history' — 3 shockproof assets for instant insurance now\n\nSchiff, who said in June 2023 that his “net worth is a lot more than $80 million,” would fit within the Fed’s top 1% definition for Q4 2023 — but unlike some of his wealthy peers, the growth in his net worth was somewhat restricted by his investing philosophy, which is hyper-focused on gold.\n\nWhen quizzed by Patrick Bet-David, host of the PBD Podcast, about how much his net worth has increased over the past decade, Schiff said: “It’s hard to say. My investment portfolio has gone up. In fact, the non-gold portion over that time frame has done better. Now, my gold stocks did very well from 2000 to 2010-11, but over the last 10 years, I have bigger winners in the other half of my portfolio than I do in the gold stocks.”\n\nIf wealth generation was his sole focus, Schiff said he could have earned even more money by investing more heavily in the “Magnificent Seven,” all of which have dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 in the past decade.\n\n“I did not do that,” he said — and here’s why.\n\nSoaring stock portfolios ‘all artificial’\n\nSchiff believes the $44.6 trillion held by America’s top 1% is “all artificial [and] all on paper because of what we claim stocks are worth.”\n\nHe believes investors are simply “benefiting from the inflated asset price level” caused by the Fed’s monetary policy decisions in the past decade — specifically the low interest rate policy (hovering near 0%) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and the two years prior.\n\n“Most of these Americans, if they tried to sell their stocks, the market would crash,” Schiff argued. “So, you have all these billionaires whose wealth is a function of the price of their stock. If they actually tried to sell their stock, it wouldn’t be that high.”\n\nGold, on the other hand, is a more stable investment, according to Schiff. In a possible scenario where the U.S. economy tanks and investors panic-sell their stocks, he believes gold is more likely to retain its purchasing power and protect your overall net worth.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nJeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe— you may want to do the same in 2024\n\n'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs — take advantage today\n\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse.

        "text": "The Nintendo Switch 2 may use Samsung 5th generation V-NAND, which would be a huge step up from its predecessor, judging from some recent findings.\n\nAs reported by Doctre81 in a new video shared on YouTube, the LinkedIn page of a former Samsung Electronics Device Solution Division Senior Director who's been at the company until 2019 lists among key qualifications and responsibilities having led the development of a NAND Flash Controller device for an unspecified Nintendo game card. Among the key achievements, the former Samsung employee also lists the development of Secure eMMC Card powered by Samsung Memory's 5th generation V-NAND Flash, which seems to line up not only with the NAND Flash Controller device for the unspecified Nintendo game card but also with some other information, such as innovating security for unspecified proprietary hardware and designing a new PUF IP (Physical Unclonable Function).\n\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 requiring faster read speeds than its predecessor isn't exactly surprising, but Nintendo using Samsung 5th Generation V-NAND is still great news, even though it is, by today's standards, somewhat dated tech, as Samsung is working on 9th and 10th generations V-NAND, with the latter planned to be released in 2025. Still, the up to 1.4 GB/s speeds featured by the 5th generation should be more than enough for the new console, and a major step up from its predecessor.\n\nVery little is known about the Nintendo Switch 2, other than the fact that it will be powered once again by NVIDIA technology. The T239 chip will be a massive step up over the Tegra X1 chip powering the current Nintendo system, as it is said to support features such as NVIDIA DLSS upscaling and Ray Reconstrunction that is will likely make it the best ray tracing capable gaming system on the market.",

        "text": "holy fucking shit!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI've had this in my drafts to finish writing up for a few weeks but today I made another discovery that has pushed me to finally write it up lol.\n\nMy PC had a few hiccups over the past couple of years. Nothing so serious that I was truly concerned (at first) but, annoyances, to be sure. (\"PC? Weren't you talking about a TV??\" you might be thinking to yourself. Yes. I'll get there. Oh, will I ever get there.)\n\nFor a long time, the most serious hiccup with my PC was being unable to open Display Settings on my PC. I had to use Nvidia control panel to make adjustments. Whatever. Didn't affect my ability to work or anything. I had just updated to Windows 11 so I thought maybe something went wrong in the update. So I did another install (which meant I had to re-install a ton of music plugin stuff on my computer which takes ages given all the stuff I use.)\n\nThe fresh install still didn't fix it. So I simply ignored it for the better part of 2 years.\n\nOver time, so slowly I didn't really clock them as being related, other things started to fail.\n\nI have a Komplete Kontrol S88 midi Keyboard that interfaces with Kontakt and Komplete Kontrol in my DAW. I can use the keyboard to adjust settings or select instruments without having to look at my computer screen. At some point last year this stopped working. I could still use it to input midi, and I was afraid I'd have to do a fresh install of all the Native Instruments stuff I use, so I kept putting off trying to fix it until I had less going on with work. It worked, just not as well as it should!\n\nThen, Task manager started to hang in weird ways. It wouldn't close unless I forced it closed with ProcExp. Whatever! Computers are weird!\n\nI had trouble getting video capture cards to connect when I considered streaming Splatoon. Whatever! I'm not a streamer, I should probably use that energy on something else.\n\nBut then, in March, I had some things fail that, turns out, are pretty necessary to using the computer.\n\nI was trying to get remote desktop to work on my tablet so I could work in the living room closer to my cat, Grendel, who was still very much in mourning for his best friend (<3 Guts). Grendel is at his happiest when he's napping on the couch next to a human. So I thought, hey, I could do some stuff in remote desktop mode! It wasn't something I used very often because it doesn't play super nice with audio, it'd been probably over a year since I last used it, but I knew it had worked and had been easy to set up.\n\nWell. It refused to connect despite appearing as an option on my tablet. And as I was trying to troubleshoot this problem...\n\nMy task bars on my PC disappeared! If I moused over the spot they should have been I got the loading circle. And my monitors would jitter!\n\nSystem settings were nowhere to be found. To navigate I had to open Task Manager (which if you recall was already acting strange and sluggish for the past year) in order to open the command panel, which I'd then use to launch programs. Or, attempt to. If I tried to open the system settings, my PC spat out \"Uhhh what's \"Settings\"? We ain't got settings\" (in command I got \"C:\\Windows\\System32>start ms-settings: Access is denied.\" despite being in admin mode )\n\nSO I started to panic a wee bit. It's not a great time for me to possibly need a new PC! Plus, it works great when it works .\n\nI manually backed up everything important from my main PC drive (as I could not access the windows backup program because it lived in settings!!!!!!!!) and downloaded the Windows 11 installer to a drive in case I needed to completely wipe my computer and start fresh.\n\nIn a last ditch effort, I tried updating my Nvidia GeForce graphics driver and restarted.\n\nLo and behold, my taskbars came back and I could access settings again! Huzzah!\n\nThis lasted for 6 days. And then the taskbars disappeared AGAIN along with Settings.\n\nAt least by now I'd become somewhat comfortable using command to get around, so I was less panicked than I was in round 1. I at least knew the computer wouldn't crash and delete all my shit suddenly (plus I had my backups that were up-to-date).\n\nI asked my friends if they'd ever heard of anything like this, and Cohost's own @ vogon helped me poke around some additional graphics driver stuff in case updating to the new Nvidia program that's in beta would solve my issue. This felt super promising when I went into safe mode and saw taskbars. So, I did the update, and, as before, when I updated, the taskbars came back! But there were gone again almost immediately. My screen literally started flickering and they vanished. It was so fucking bizarre.\n\nI turned to google once more, hoping that somehow, as useless as google is these days, maybe I'd find what I needed to fix my damn computer!\n\nSomehow, against all odds, I found it. I happened to use the exact right string in my search to pull up some reddit threads. The first one didn't have anything useful, but a few results down I spotted \"no taskbar and task manager freezes\" holy moly!!!\n\nAt first glance however, there wasn't anything useful. But then I spotted some collapsed comments at the bottom of the thread. I knew more than likely they just had comments like \"sucks bro\" or \"this is why i use linux :/\" But I expanded them and inside was a link to a Microsoft forum post. I kept my expectations in check and clicked on the link. What I saw had my nearly vibrating in my seat.\n\nThis was the solution.\n\nNarayan B\n\nNov 16, 2023, 12:20 AM\n\nSo I finally solved it!\n\nSource of the problem: an Android TV (HiSense model) connected to my network. Yes. A TV caused this issue.\n\nHISENSE? LIKE THE SAME BRAND OF TV I HAVE HAD SINCE 2020???\n\nI followed the instructions. I deleted keys generated by our TV for 5 straight minutes. 5 Minutes of like 200BPM clicking. I restarted. Everything worked again. I laughed so hard I cried. I felt like I'd solved a murder. The main suspect was the PC but the culprit was the TV in the other room. And he almost got away with it!!! If I had spent a few days carrying out a clean install and re-installing all my work stuff, my problem would have come back. If I had taken the PC out back and shot it and replaced it with a fancy new computer, the problem would have come back.\n\nBecause the problem was never the PC. The Problem was my Hisense TV in the next room.\n\nOnce I carried this out, I was able to open display settings for the first time (outside of safe mode) in 2 years. When I deleted the keys, my Task Manager started behaving normally again. I turned around and saw that my keyboard was once again displaying the VST controls on its screen. The fancy midi keyboard was back at full functionality. I was able to connect my CRT as a display again using the HDMI -> RCA converters I'd assumed had stopped working (nope! they still worked, they always worked!)\n\nWhich brings me to today. Almost a month later everything still works. So, I decided to see if remote desktop would magically work again. The answer is: Yes. Yes, in fact, my TV was the reason my remote desktop connection had failed the month before.\n\nSo here I am, sitting on my couch with my tablet and bluetooth keeb and mouse, writing this post in remote desktop mode so I could attach screenshots of this saga to my post without sitting at my PC. Grendel is snoring beside me as I write.\n\nAs a treat for reading this far, please enjoy two screenshots of my friends reacting to the solution of my great mystery.\n\nadding: the TV in question, in case you're curious: Hisense 50Q8G- 50\" Smart 4K ULED™ Android TV with Quantum Dot Technology (Canada Model)",

        "text": "Both AMD Radeon RX 7000 & NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 GPUs are available below their official MSRP in Germany as the discounting spree continues.\n\nGerman PC Builders Are Enjoying GPU Discounts With All AMD Radeon RX 7000 & NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Graphics Cards Available Below Their MSRP\n\nThe last few weeks have been wild in terms of prices as AMD Radeon RX 7000 GPUs are retailing below MSRP globally, and by the looks of it, things don't stop just yet. 3DCenter has tracked the pricing of AMD's GPUs across German retailers, specifically Geizhals. Interestingly, the data also includes a comparison with US markets, which shows how aggressive the drop was in the region.\n\nBased on 3DCenter's compilation, the outlet has compared US MSRPs and how the retail price differs in the region and drawn parallels with EU MSRPs and current retail pricing. Based on the US differences, the average GPU price drop is recorded at -2.9%, while in Germany, the drop was -11%, which is indeed huge considering that EU pricing is slightly higher considering the regional taxation policies. These average price drops include both AMD Radeon RX 7000 and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 GPU lineups.\n\nOfficial MSRP Newegg Price Difference Converted (US to EU) EU Price (Lowest) Difference Radeon RX 7600 $269 $270 ±0 = €300 259€ –13.7% Radeon RX 7600 XT $329 $330 ±0 = €368 338€ –8.2% Radeon RX 7700 XT $409 $395 –3.4% = 457€ 424€ –7.2% Radeon RX 7800 XT $499 $500 ±0 = €557 519€ –6.8% Radeon RX 7900 GRE $549 $550 ±0 = €613 576€ –6.0% Radeon RX 7900 XT $899 $690 –23.2% = €1004 €739 –26.4% Radeon RX 7900 XTX $999 $900 –9.9% = €1116 948€ –15.1% GeForce RTX 4090 $1599 $1770 +10.7% = €1786 1739€ –2.6% GeForce RTX 4080 Super $999 $1000 ±0 = €1116 1059€ –5.1% GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super $799 $800 ±0 = €893 €849 –4.9% GeForce RTX 4070 Super $599 $590 –1.5% = €669 597€ –10.8% GeForce RTX 4070 $549 $550 ±0 = €613 539€ –12.1% GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB $499 $450 –9.8% = €557 446€ –19.9% GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 8GB $399 $385 –3.5% = €446 €379 –15.0% GeForce RTX 4060 $299 $290 –3.0% = €334 €295 –11.7% Average Price Difference (vs MSRP) –2.9% –11.0%\n\nThe GPU that witnessed the most significant drop was AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XT, recorded at €739. Other models, like AMD's Radeon RX 7600, saw notable drops, suggesting that the discount wave affected every other retailer.\n\nMoreover, at NVIDIA's camp, things did tend to look progressive as well, as GeForce RTX 40 mid-tier models saw yet again formidable discounts, especially the more budget-friendly ones such as the GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4070 series, all witnessing double-digit price drops. The graphics card with the least price reduction was the GeForce RTX 4090 which is just -2.6% below MSRP. Both US & EU are now seeing reductions in the prices for the flagship RTX 40 card after months of it hovering around the $2000 US mark. The card is now close to its official MSRP of $1599 US in the US too.\n\nImage Source: AMD\n\nNow, the reason behind such price drops is simple. We are currently in the timeframe where companies are preparing next-gen consumer GPU solutions with RDNA 4 and Blackwell on the horizon (expected in 2H 2024); hence, they are focusing on inventory corrections and reducing levels to accommodate the upcoming units. It was recently highlighted how the older RDNA 2 GPUs are seeing \"Dead-Level\" inventories, leading to price hikes across certain models which don't make them look as attractive as they once were against the RDNA 3 family.\n\nSo, for those looking to transition toward RDNA 3 or even the Ada Lovelace series, now might be the best time to snag some units up, or you can take a risk or wait even further since the drop is expected to continue moving ahead.\n\nNVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 GPU Prices [Newegg]:\n\nGraphics Card Name Variant Original Price Lowest Price [20/04/24] Purchase Link [Affiliate] NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Gigabyte Gaming OC $1619.99 $1619.99 Buy Here!

        "text": "Data centers' energy usage is expected to soar in the coming years, experts say.\n\nABC News is taking a look at solutions for issues related to climate change and the environment with the series, “The Power of Us: People, The Climate, and Our Future.”\n\nArtificial intelligence, cryptocurrency and remote work – all of these buzzy trends depend on processing power delivered by a sprawling worldwide network of data centers.\n\nAs demand surges for the power-intensive complexes, which typically span 100,000 square feet, the increased energy usage could jeopardize the fight to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change, experts told ABC News.\n\n\"The growth trend is super-fast,\" Fengqi You, an energy engineering professor at Cornell University, told ABC News. \"This is something I'm concerned about.\"\n\nIn 2022, roughly 2,700 data centers in the U.S. accounted for over 4% of the nation's electricity use, according to an International Energy Agency report released in January. By 2026, that share of electricity use is expected to reach 6%.\n\nThe proportion of U.S. electricity use for data centers is expected to continue to climb in the ensuing years, the report said, citing anticipated broader adoption of AI and crypto.\n\nBy 2026, the AI industry alone is expected to consume at least ten times its energy demand from just three years prior, the IEA report found.\n\nNvidia, a California-based firm that sells the majority of computer chips behind the AI boom, exemplifies this growth. Over three months ending in January, the company's revenue surged 265% compared to the same period a year prior, an earnings report showed.\n\n\"If Nvidia keeps growing in the way they're hoping they'll grow and keeps selling in the way they're planning to, that's a fairly large increase in energy usage,\" Arman Shehabi, a staff scientist in energy technologies at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, told ABC News.\n\nIn response to ABC News' request for comment, a Nvidia spokesperson said the company's products would reduce energy use in data centers, since Nvidia uses accelerated computing enabled by specialized hardware called a graphics processing unit, or GPU.\n\n“Replacing conventional servers with GPU-accelerated systems will reduce, not increase, energy use in datacenters,\" the spokesperson said. \"For example, a single GPU-accelerated server can replace hundreds of conventional servers to accomplish the same workload. And our GPUs enable AI-enhanced systems that will be more energy efficient across all industries, including transportation, manufacturing, logistics, and energy, among others.”\n\nIn its fiscal year 2023 annual corporate responsibility report, the company highlighted what they said were AI-driven tools helping to address climate change, including carbon reduction and management.\n\nCryptocurrency, meanwhile, accounted for about 0.4% of global energy consumption in 2022, which was equivalent to the total energy footprint of the Netherlands that same year, the IEA report found. The primary strain on data centers imposed by crypto is the result of crypto mining, which is the computing process used to complete transactions and generate new coins.\n\nThe IAD71 Amazon Web Services data center in Ashburn, Virginia, March 27, 2024. Nathan Howard/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIn addition, the shift to remote work caused as much as a 35% spike in demand for data-center usage during the COVID-19 pandemic, Tevfik Kosar, professor of computer science and engineering at the University at Buffalo, told ABC News.\n\nWhile the increased demand ebbed as many employees returned to work, the persistence of hybrid work arrangements has elevated such data-center demand above pre-pandemic levels, he added.\n\n\"That capacity increase didn't really go back to normal,\" Kosar said.\n\nIn all, the electric power sector accounted for nearly a quarter of U.S. carbon emissions in 2022, making it the second-largest industry emitter behind transportation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says on its website. More than half of the nation's electricity came from fossil-fuel sources, including coal and natural gas, the EPA adds.\n\nThe information technology sector – of which data centers make up a key part – accounts for about 3% of global carbon emissions, which matches the share of worldwide emissions produced by the aviation industry, Kosar said.\n\n\"That is not so small,\" he noted.\n\nShehabi, of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said efforts are underway to improve the sustainability of data centers by connecting them with renewable sources of electricity. As data centers boom in the coming years, they will offer a test case for how to accommodate a spike in electricity usage while addressing the climate impact, Shehabi said.\n\n\"How we address that growth will set the stage of how we address the growth of other economic sectors over the coming decades in a way that's sustainable,\" Shehabi added.",

        "text": "Erying, the creators of several MoTD (Mobile on Desktop) motherboards has released its new Polestar series with Intel 13th Gen HX CPUs.\n\nUp To Intel Core i9-13980HX 24-Core CPU! Erying's Latest Polestar MoTD Motherboards Start At $270 US For 16 Cores\n\nThe motherboard manufacturer is known to utilize Intel's mobility CPUs under the \"HX\" and \"H\" series and repurpose them from the mobile segment to desktop solutions. These parts are often seen as the better value options, offering a decent motherboard and CPU combo package at very affordable price points.\n\n2 of 9\n\nThe latest launch from Erying is the Polestar MoDT HX which is a brand new motherboard design featuring Intel's high-end 13th Gen Raptor Lake-HX SKUs. The motherboard comes in three CPU flavors, the top 24-core Core i9-13980HX. This chip has a total of 32 threads, a boost clock of up to 5.60 GHz, 36 MB of L3 cache, and a TDP rated at 55W base / 157W MTP. The Core i9-13900HX option is similar in core specs and just reduces the clock speeds to 5.40 GHz (max). Lastly, there's the Core i7-13700HX which is the 16-core option with 24 threads, up to 5.0 GHz clocks, 30 MB L3 cache, and the same TDP.\n\nImage Source: Erying\n\nAs for the motherboard itself, Erying seems to have upgraded the design from its previous Polestar offerings to support the higher-end Intel 13th Gen HX CPUs. The new motherboard design features the CPU embedded on the motherboard (BGA) with a large vapor chamber baseplate attached on top of it. The CPU is powered by a 10-phase VRM and receives power through an 8-pin connector.\n\nImage Source: Erying\n\nThe motherboard houses four DDR5 DIMM slots which support up to 192 GB capacities at speeds of up to 5600 MT/s (OC support XMP 3.0) and the expansion area is where things get interesting with the Erying Polestar MoTD HX offering two PCIe 4.0 x16 slots and three Gen4 M.2 slots. There are also four SATA III ports. The motherboard has all the necessary I/O such as fan headers, RGB headers, DEBUG LEDs, and even comes with dual BIOS. It is based on the higher-end H770 chipset too. Large heatsinks are seen over the VRMs, PCH & the rear panel I/O also has a pre-installed I/O plate and a top I/O cover which adds a nice touch.\n\nIn terms of I/O, the Erying Polestar MoTD HX motherboard features a single DP, two HDMI ports, four USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, a Type-C port, 2.5 GbE LAN, WIFI5 and 3-channel audio jack. There's also a clear CMOS switch on the back.\n\nImage Source: Erying\n\nErying has also shared some performance, thermal, and power metrics of the Polstar MoTD HX motherboard using the Intel Core i9-13900HX CPU. The CPU can be set to run around its default TDP or tuned for higher performance with unlocked TDPs of up to 260W. In AIDA64 FPU tests, the system reaches a power consumption of 350W when running with a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 GPU.\n\n2 of 9\n\nThe CPU can get a bit toasty as Erying was using a 360mm AIO liquid cooler and the mobility chip ended up at around 90C temps (95C max) when loaded up in the stress test. This should be kind of expected since these are essentially desktop dies repurposed for high-end mobility platforms. The following performance metrics compare the 150W mode against the 260W mode in several games and applications:\n\n2 of 9\n\nIn terms of pricing, Erying's Polestar MoTD HX motherboards with the Intel 13th Gen HX CPU options are priced very well. The Intel Core i7-13700HX option starts at $270 US while the Core i9-13900HX option starts at $340 US. The 13980HX option will be priced around $370 US which is a great price considering the performance more or less matches the Core i9-13900K and you're also getting a motherboard which should cost around $150 US.\n\nErying Polestar MoTD HX (Core i9-13980HX) - 2599 RMB ($366 US)\n\n2599 RMB ($366 US) Erying Polestar MoTD HX (Core i9-13900HX) - 2399 RMB ($337 US)\n\n2399 RMB ($337 US) Erying Polestar MoTD HX (Core i7-13700HX) - 1899 RMB ($267 US)\n\nThese are great options for mainstream builders who can get a great combo package despite there being no upgrade option in the future (for the CPU).",

        "text": "Astera Labs, a relatively unknown semiconductor company with a $10 billion market value, recently showed off its new Aries 6 PCIe retimer board, which it is now sampling to leading AI and cloud infrastructure providers.\n\nDue to the high-speed data transfer within the PCIe interface, the signals can suffer from degradation, especially over longer distances or due to interference. A PCIe retimer helps maintain the data signal integrity over the PCIe interface by cleaning, reshaping, and retransmitting the data signals.\n\nThe Aries 6 retimers, the first in Astera Labs' PCIe 6.x portfolio, offer robust, low power, and efficient PCIe 6.x and CXL 3.x connectivity, squarely aimed at catering to the networking requirements of next-generation GPUs, accelerators, CPUs, and CXL memory controllers.\n\n3x the reach\n\nBased on Intel's Retimer Supplemental Specification, the new Aries 6 retimers build upon the company’s widely deployed PCIe 5.0 retimer portfolio and reportedly extend reach distance by three times the standard rate.\n\nCasey Morrison, Chief Product Officer, Astera Labs, said, “PCIe 6.x technology’s superior bandwidth is required to handle data-intensive workloads and to maximize utilization of AI accelerators, but the faster speeds introduce new signal integrity issues in hyperscale platforms. Aries Smart DSP Retimers have set the gold standard for addressing critical PCIe/CXL connectivity challenges with a solid track record of robust performance and seamless interoperability. We’re proud that our third generation of Aries Retimers with support for PCIe 6.x, PCIe 5.x, and CXL 3.x have now been sampled to leading AI and cloud platform providers.”\n\nServeTheHome took a first look at Astera Labs’s new portfolio at Nvidia GTC 2024 (see the photograph above) and observed that the “Aries 6 was linked at PCIe Gen6 x16 speeds at 10-11W of power consumption. That is a big deal since it is lower than Broadcom is claiming with its new retimers.“\n\nMany major AI firms are excited about the imminent arrival of Astera Labs’ new generation Aries Smart DSP Retimers. Raghu Nambiar, Corporate Vice President, Data Center Ecosystems and Solutions, AMD, said, “Our close collaboration with Astera Labs on PCIe technologies ensures our customers’ platforms continue to meet the higher bandwidth connectivity requirements of next-generation AI and HPC workloads,” while Brian Kelleher, Senior Vice President of GPU Engineering, Nvidia, added, “Astera Labs’ new Aries Smart DSP Retimers with support for PCIe 6.2 will help enable higher bandwidth to optimize utilization of our next-generation computing platforms.”\n\nAre you a pro?

Two days ago I started getting some weird errors which stopped my machine learning development stuff from working. I don't remember exactly what these errors were off the top of my head (sorry, if I knew my PC would fail to reboot I would have saved them), but I think they were NVidia-related. Anyway, I attempt to reboot and got nothing. See links below for some videos showing exactly what \"nothing\" means.\n\nI immediately tried running Boot-Repair from the bootable USB I have for just such cases, which has always fixed such problems in the past. No dice. OK, annoying, but not a huge deal. I have backups and scripts for getting my environments and everything set up rapidly, so I'll just reinstall Ubuntu, a couple hours and I'll be back up and running.\n\nI am on day three of this problem now. I have tried installing Ubuntu 22.04, 23.10, and the 24.04 beta. I have tried all three of these on two disks - the original SSD I previously had the working 22.04 install on, and a brand new NVMe M.2 drive I bought specifically for this purpose. Everything I try results in the exact same problem I got upon reboot after the previously-working install suddenly failed. To be exact, that problem is this:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/o336q3GMMvY https://youtu.be/CSJC5piuKM4 (LOL sorry these are upside-down, dunno what happened there...)\n\nEither one of these two things happens. Sometimes, as in the first vid, I get to a screen with a non-flash cursor where I cannot type anything (no inputs produce any effect, have tried every key on my keyboard), or I just land on a black screen. Last night I left the unblinking cursor screen up overnight just to see if it was actually doing anything in the background. It was just stuck there.\n\nUbuntu worked fine for years, then just failed one day after no hardware changes or software updates that I'm aware of, and now any new install fails to work as if my PC has an immune system that just spontaneously developed an Ubuntu allergy.

All attempts to install Ubuntu have been done by downloading the ISO on Windows 10, writing it to a live USB with Rufus, shutting the PC down, removing the Windows 10 SSD, then letting the installer do its thing (using the recommended install or whatever it's called, i.e. I have changed no partition/installer settings at all) on either the SSD I previously used for Ubuntu, or the new NVMe M.2 drive that I just bought.\n\nHardware specs:\n\nMPG B550 GAMING PLUS Motherboard\n\nAMD Ryzen 5 5600X 6-Core 3.70 GHz\n\n16GB RAM\n\nGPU: Nvidia RTX 3080",

        "text": "When it comes to Keynesian central banking, it might well be said that if you paint by the numbers you are stuck with the brush. That is to say, the Fed has turned its 2.00% target into an economic holy grail and therefore does not dare risk a rebound of the 40-year high inflationary pressures that remain directly in the rearview mirror.\n\nYes, the inflation gauges have cooled considerably since the 9% CPI (Consumer Price Index) peak of June 2022, but the Fed is not yet remotely out of the woods. In fact, when the inflation tide is viewed through the more stable and reliable lens of the 16% trimmed mean CPI, which peaked at a somewhat lower 7.2% level in 2022, the year-over-year (Y/Y) gain at 3.7% in January was still barely halfway back to the sacrosanct 2.00% goal.\n\nIndeed, the annualized three-month rate of change in the trimmed mean CPI has rebounded to 4.0% already, while the annualized rate for January came in at a red hot 5.7%.\n\nSo, as much as the boys and girls on Wall Street insist on getting their juice, the paint-by-the-numbers crowd in the Eccles Building (Fed HQ) is not nearly there yet.\n\nY/Y Change in the 16% Trimmed Mean CPI, April 2020 to January 2024\n\nFor avoidance of doubt, just recall the horrific charts of 1967 to 1982. Back then the good folks in charge of the Fed were not even explicitly in the Greenspanian monetary central planning business but still had to generate four recessions during that span in order to get the inflation genie back in the jar. Reclaiming the America... Justin Raimondo Best Price: $3.59 Buy New $14.00 (as of 10:35 UTC - Details)\n\nTo be sure, the twentysomething traders on Wall Street, who are braying ever more insistently for initiation of the next rate cut cycle, undoubtedly confuse the 1970s with the 1790s. It’s all an ancient blur in their minds, apparently.\n\nThe graybeards working toward their pensions in the Eccles Building, however, are not quite so nonchalant. They recall the triple peak of inflation from that era and undoubtedly still have the chart on their dashboards. The thundering central bank failure implicit in three inflationary surges (red bars) and four recessionary contractions (white areas) in just over a decade nearly destroyed the Fed’s open-ended remit as the nation’s unelected monetary politburo, to say nothing of its credibility on both ends of the Acela Corridor (New York and Washington, D.C.).\n\nY/Y Change in the CPI, 1967 to 1984\n\nTherefore the current gang in charge is not about to flinch on their “higher for longer” call until they can see clearly the whites of those 2.00% inflationary eyes.\n\nWe don’t expect this prayed-for condition to be attained any time soon. That’s because the truth of the “lowflation” mirage of the last several decades cannot be buried indefinitely, nor even for much longer. Union Terror: Debunkin... Addicott, Dr. Jeffrey F Best Price: $19.76 Buy New $21.95 (as of 12:59 UTC - Details)\n\nWe are referring, of course, to the fact that there was a whole lot of inflation from the Fed’s madcap money printing even before it pulled out the stops on its printing presses in response to the so-called COVID-crisis in March 2020. But most of that came out in financial asset prices and in the real estate sector, bubbles that Wall Street pronounced to be a swell thing.\n\nAt the same time, most of the rest was temporarily exported to the rest of the world via the Fed’s flood of dollar liabilities, which were compliantly scooped up by mercantilist central banks in China, the petro-states and elsewhere in the rapidly mushrooming low-cost global manufacturing supply chains.\n\nThe chart below is not simply striking evidence that the 1.8% average inflation rate during the first two decades of this century was an aberration; it is actually the smoking gun!\n\nIndex of US Unit Labor Costs, 1970 to 2020\n\nThe Fed had grotesquely inflated the US economy during the 1970s cycles shown above and had been merely content to slow the further rise of these drastically higher price levels by the aforementioned 2.0% per annum during the later 1980s and 1990s. This occurred even as Mr. Deng was converting Mao’s ossified Communist economy into a manufacturing powerhouse by dint of a red hot capitalist style printing press at the People’s Bank of China and several hundred millions of newly-minted industrial workers flushed out of the rice paddies and subsistence villages of China.\n\nAmerican industry and wage workers had no chance. Thanks to the pro-inflation policies of the Fed both before and after Greenspan — save for the short interval of “Tall Paul” Volcker’s rescue of the American economy from the inflationary abyss — unit labor costs by the year 2000 were 235% higher than they had been in 1970 and by the eve of the pandemic crisis in March 2020 were actually up by 310%.\n\nOf course, the soaring purple line in the chart above wasn’t supposed to matter according to the Keynesian economists running US economic policy. If America’s trade deficit got too large owing to massive offshoring and mushrooming trade deficits, surplus countries abroad like China were supposed to experience exchange rate appreciation and thereby an offsetting reduction in their competitive cost advantage.\n\nAlas, that assumed printing-press money in the US would be countered by sound money abroad. Fat chance!\n\nForeign central banks printed stride for stride and then some with the Fed under what is best described as the “dirty float.” So doing, they bought up trillions of unwanted dollars, expanding their own money supplies as they did so, thereby keeping their trade surpluses intact and showering their export industries with cheap credit and capital.\n\nSo offshoring never slowed down. The exchange rate corrections and rebalancing of trade accounts never happened.\n\nThere is no mystery, therefore, about the cause of the great labor arbitrage and resulting offshoring of America’s industrial economy over the last 40 years. To wit, the objective condition of the global economy and internet linkages of producers and consumers everywhere on the planet meant that the US needed a sustained period of cost deflation to purge the inflationary excesses of the 1970s and after, not the pro-inflation policy that the Fed actually conducted.\n\nFor want of doubt, the chart below tells you all you need to know. Shortly after the turn of the century, the manufacturing wage gap between the US and China was 22X and even by 2015 it was still in the 5X range. And yet, the foolish Keynesian academics in the Eccles Building saw fit to essentially contend that still more inflation was the key to prosperity, a la their 2.00% target.\n\nNevertheless, the great labor arbitrage is now drawing to a swift close, in large part because China has completely drained its rice paddies. That is to say, as a matter of demographics and the legacy of its one-child policy, the Red Ponzi labor force peaked in 2015 and is now shrinking and will be shrinking as far as the eye can see.\n\nAccordingly, wage costs are rising rapidly in China because even the Red Ponzi has not found a way to repeal the laws of supply and demand. Accordingly, the wage gap has narrowed to less than 20% and will likely disappear entirely before the end of the current decade.\n\nThe Great Labor Cost Arbitrage, 2000 to 2025\n\nThe underlying truth is that the Great Labor Arbitrage was a one-time event, not a permanent condition of the global economy. There are simply no more Chinas left on planet earth or even the nearby solar system.\n\nAnd that gets us exactly to the Fed’s impending monetary Waterloo. It was able to print with relative impunity during the 1990 to 2020 period because the one-time export of the US industrial economy caused an utterly aberrant split screen deformation of the domestic price level.\n\nTo wit, the merchandise goods coming back into the US economy from offshore production were priced at levels far below the hideously inflated level of domestic production costs. As a result, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) deflator for durable goods (black line) actually declined by nearly 40% between 1995 and early 2020. That reflected not only the surging import share of durable goods, but the fact that on-margin imports set the price of domestically produced goods as well.\n\nPCE Deflator: Durable Goods Versus Services, 1995 to 2020\n\nThere has never been anything like this sweeping deflation in the modern economic era. It was literally a freak of economic history, beyond any plausible avenue of continuation or replication.\n\nBy contrast, the PCE deflator for services, which are largely produced domestically and therefore within the Fed’s realm of influence, rose by more than 85% during the same period.\n\nIn annualized terms, therefore, the durables index declined by 2% per annum for a full quarter-century while the services index rose by 2.5% per year. It was a pure statistical anomaly and gift of dumb luck to the Eccles Building that the resulting overall PCE deflator rose, on the math, at 1.85% per annum.\n\nAnd yet, and yet. The Keynesian pointy heads at the Fed declared this spat of dumb luck to be a “lowflation” problem requiring aggressive and sustained operations of its printing presses. In effect, they were looking a gift horse in the mouth and pretending it was an ogre.\n\nNeedless to say, with Chinese wages and costs rising rapidly and the arbitrage gap nearly closed, there is not a snowball’s chance in the hot place that the black line in the chart above will take another 40% dump lower. Not in a million years.\n\nAnd that means, in turn, that the yawning gap in the above chart between goods deflation and services inflation will not recur. As it happens, the underlying services inflation is still in the +5% Y/Y range and will dominate the topline price level going forward far more heavily than it did during the aberrant era of 40% durables deflation.\n\nAccordingly, the “lowflation” excuse for money printing is now deader than a doornail.\n\nThe fact is inflation isn’t and won’t be contained even at the Fed’s specious 2.00% target. And the last two decades have proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that aggressive money printing does not spur domestic investment and productivity, and therefore overall economic growth either.\n\nWhat it does do is inflate asset bubbles on Wall Street because ultra-low interest rates purportedly justify higher price-to-earnings multiples. And that’s been the excuse all along for taking the Fed’s balance sheet from $300 billion when Greenspan was hit with the Black Monday meltdown in October 1987 to a peak of $9 trillion a few months back.\n\nAlas, financial asset bubbles aren’t indefinitely sustainable either. They actually rang the bell on Wall Street Thursday when NVIDIA brushed up against a market cap of $2 trillion, representing 30X sales of chips that enable the likes of Google’s generative AI to render portraits of black people dressed as Vikings.\n\nEven the Tulip Bulb Mania of 1637 never went that crazy.\n\nY/Y Change in CPI for Services, 2011 to 2024\n\nReprinted with permission from David Stockman’s Contra Corner.\n\nThe Best of David Stockman",
        "summary": "When it comes to Keynesian central banking, it might well be said that if you paint by the numbers you are stuck with the brush. It’s all an ancient blur in their minds, apparently. We don’t expect this prayed-for condition to be attained any time soon. Union Terror: Debunkin... Addicott, Dr. Jeffrey F Best Price: $19.76 Buy New $21.95 (as of 12:59 UTC - Details)\n\nWe are referring, of course, to the fact that there was a whole lot of inflation from the Fed’s madcap money printing even before it pulled out the stops on its printing presses in response to the so-called COVID-crisis in March 2020. But most of that came out in financial asset prices and in the real estate sector, bubbles that Wall Street pronounced to be a swell thing. If America’s trade deficit got too large owing to massive offshoring and mushrooming trade deficits, surplus countries abroad like China were supposed to experience exchange rate appreciation and thereby an offsetting reduction in their competitive cost advantage. For want of doubt, the chart below tells you all you need to know. Accordingly, wage costs are rising rapidly in China because even the Red Ponzi has not found a way to repeal the laws of supply and demand. There are simply no more Chinas left on planet earth or even the nearby solar system. It was literally a freak of economic history, beyond any plausible avenue of continuation or replication. By contrast, the PCE deflator for services, which are largely produced domestically and therefore within the Fed’s realm of influence, rose by more than 85% during the same period. The Keynesian pointy heads at the Fed declared this spat of dumb luck to be a “lowflation” problem requiring aggressive and sustained operations of its printing presses. In effect, they were looking a gift horse in the mouth and pretending it was an ogre."

Though the market's rally has broadened this year, megacap stocks remain a portfolio staple, with fund managers in the latest BofA Global Research survey once again naming them the market's \"most crowded\" trade.Many believe their results could be especially important to markets this time around. The S&P 500 has slid in recent weeks, roughly halving its year-to-date gain to 5% as stickier-than-expected inflation erodes the prospects for the Federal Reserve to cut rates this year.Additionally, the monthslong rally in stocks has made the index expensive relative to history at a time when rising Treasury yields are pressuring equity valuations. Disappointing earnings from the market's heavyweights could give investors less reason to hold stocks.\"Psychologically, the companies coming in at or above expectations is important,\" said David Katz, chief investment officer with Matrix Asset Advisors. \"There's a lot of good news built into a lot of these companies.\"Investors will also focus on next Friday's release of the monthly Personal Consumption Expenditures Price index, a crucial piece of inflation data before the Fed's April 30-May 1 meeting. Fed funds futures late Thursday were pricing in less than 40 basis points in rate cuts this year, down from 150 bps expected at the start of 2024, according to LSEG data.The performance of megacaps' shares has diverged in 2024, after last year's epic run. Tesla, which reports results on Tuesday, has seen its shares tumble about 40% in 2024 amid concerns about its electric vehicle business.Meta Platforms, whose shares have jumped over 40% in 2024, is due on Wednesday, while Alphabet and Microsoft, which are logging year-to-date gains of about 12% and 7.5% respectively, are set for Thursday.Of the other megacaps, Apple and Amazon are set to report the following week, while Nvidia, whose shares have soared 70% this year on optimism over its artificial intelligence chips, reports on May 22.Six of the seven, excluding Tesla, are expected to post collective earnings growth of 42.1% in the first quarter, UBS strategists said on April 8.\"It appears that the expectations are that they're really going to deliver again,\" said Patrick Kaser, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global. \"And so the risk to me is skewed to the downside.\"Excluding the Magnificent 7, S&P 500 earnings have been negative on a year-over-year basis over the prior four quarters, according to JPMorgan analysts, underlining the group's importance to the market.Beyond the megacaps, over 300 S&P 500 companies expected to report over the coming two weeks. Earnings are expected to rise 9% for the full year, according to LSEG data, with added pressure on the results to support overall valuations.The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio has moderated somewhat this month but is still at 20 times, well above its long-term average of 15.7, according to LSEG Datastream.\"In an environment where there is a lot of uncertainty about Fed rate policy, there's a lot of geopolitical tensions rising, if companies aren't really pushing the pedal on giving positive outlooks for growth ... that could be the factor that weighs on stocks,\" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Aurora Ellis)",

Bitcoin jumped to over $64,000 while Arweave (AR), Ethena (ENA), and THORChain (RUNE) prices soared by double-digits.\n\nCryptocurrencies outperformed technology stocks, which continued their deep sell-off. The closely-watched Nasdaq 100 index crashed by over 300 points as the Nvidia stock plunged by over 10%. The S&P 500 index dropped by almost 1%.\n\nMeanwhile, BitBot , the fast-growing cryptocurrency continued its token sale, as it raised over $2.6 million.\n\nAltcoins have rebounded\n\nMost altcoins jumped sharply on Saturday morning. Arweave rose for three straight days to $28.95, higher than this week’s low of $21.53.\n\nEthena, on the other hand, rose above the important resistance point at $1 even as concerns about its stablecoins continued. Some investors are worried that the high-yielding USDe stablecoin could de-peg as Terra Luna USD did in 2022.\n\nThere are also concerns that a new proposed stablecoin law in the US could ban it in the country. The Lummis-Gillibrand law, if passed, will ban all unbacked stablecoins in the country.\n\nTHORChain, on the other hand, continued rising as the volume in its exchange stabilised. The exchange handled cryptocurrencies worth over $228 million, making it the 15th biggest DEX in the world.\n\nThe other top-performing altcoins on Saturday morning were Internet Computer, Sei, ORDI, Sui, and Fetch.ai.\n\nIt is unclear whether this rebound will continue considering that there are substantial interest rate risks. Analysts believe that the Federal Reserve will continue holding interest rates at an elevated level for longer.\n\nBitBot token sale continues\n\nMeanwhile, BitBot continued its token sale this week. Data on its website shows that the developers have now raised over $2.6 million in the past few weeks. The $BITBOT token was trading at $0.0163 in stage 11 of the sale and is set to increase to $0.017.\n\nFor beginners, BitBot is an upcoming company that aims to become the next big thigh in the Telegram bot market. It will be a decentralised platform where $BITBOT token holders will have a role in its decision-making.\n\nThe bot will be created using technical indicators and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools. As a result, the developers hope that it will be more accurate in making crypto predictions than other bots.\n\nFor users, there will be other benefits of using the bot. First, it will be a non-custodial bot, meaning that the developers will not have access to users funds. Second, as you will find in this white paper , holders will have exclusive access to features and presales. Third, they will take part in revenue sharing, where $BITBOT holders will receive a portion of their sales.

        "text": "In this article, we will see how to fix the Installation Failed error while updating or installing the GeForce Game Ready Driver through the NVIDIA Geforce Experience. NVIDIA Game Ready drivers deliver the best gaming experience for your favorite games. They also allow you to optimize the game settings with a single click.\n\nGeForce Game Ready Driver, Installation Failed\n\nFix GeForce Experience driver installation failed error\n\nAccording to the reports, the “Installation Failed” error message occurs while installing or updating the GeForce Game Ready Driver through the GeForce Experience app on a Windows computer. If you cannot install or update the GeForce Game Ready Driver due to this error, use the following suggestions to resolve this issue.\n\nRun the exe file as an administrator Close all other programs Disable your antivirus Turn off Memory Integrity in Windows Security Download the driver again Perform a Clean Installation of the driver Run the Chkdsk scan\n\nBelow, we have explained all these fixes in detail.\n\n1] Run the exe file as an administrator\n\nSometimes, installation errors occur due to administrative rights. The Game Ready Driver may require administrative privileges to install on your system. Right-click on the exe file and select Run as administrator. Click Yes in the UAC prompt. Now, follow the on-screen wizard to install the driver.\n\n2] Close all other programs\n\nDuring the installation of a program, it is suggested that all the running programs on a computer be closed. This is because the running programs can sometimes conflict with the installer file, due to which the installation fails. We suggest you close all the opened programs and terminate all the startup apps running in the background. You can do so via the Task Manager. After doing this, see if you can install the driver.\n\nAlso, check if Windows Update is downloading in the background. If your system downloads the Windows Update, you cannot pause or stop it. In this case, wait until the download is finished and try again.\n\n3] Temporarily disable your antivirus\n\nSometimes, an antivirus program considers a genuine file as a virus and blocks its installation. This is a false positive flag and can be avoided. This can be the case with you. Disable your third-party antivirus and then install the driver. If the error does not occur, let the installation be completed. After successfully installing the Game Ready Driver, enable the antivirus.\n\n4] Turn off Memory Integrity in Windows Security\n\nWe also suggest you disable Memory Integrity in Windows Security. Memory Integrity is a feature in Windows Security that prevents attacks from inserting malicious code into high-security processes. After turning off this feature, run the executable file and see if the error occurs this time. Don’t forget to turn on the Memory Integrity again.\n\n5] Download the driver again\n\nThe exe file you have downloaded might have been corrupted due to which you are facing the installation failed error message every time you try to install the driver. Hence, we suggest you delete that installation file, download the latest version of the GeForce Game Ready Driver from the official NVIDIA website, and then run the installation file. See if the error occurs this time.\n\n6] Perform a Clean Installation of the driver\n\nDoes the error occur while performing the Express Installation of the driver? If yes, perform the Custom Installation of the driver. The possible reason why the installation fails while performing the Express Installation of the Game Ready Driver is driver corruption. The previously installed driver might have been corrupted due to which you are not able to update or install the driver via the Express Installation option.\n\nSelect the Custom Install option and then select the “Perform a clean installation” checkbox on the next screen. This step will remove the previous version of the driver and then install the latest version of the driver.\n\nThis should work.\n\n7] Run the Chkdsk scan\n\nIf the error still occurs, there might be some bad sectors on your hard drive due to which the installation is failing. We suggest you run the chkdsk scan. After that, try again.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nWhy does NVIDIA Experience keep failing to install?\n\nThere can be many reasons why NVIDIA GeForce Experience is failing to install on your Windows computer, like a corrupted installer file, a previously installed NVIDIA GeForce Experience app, antivirus conflict, etc.\n\nHow do I clean install NVIDIA drivers?\n\nTo perform a clean installation of NVIDIA graphics drivers, run the installer file and select the Custom Install option. Now, select the Perform a clean installation checkbox. This step will remove the currently installed version of the graphics driver and then install the latest version.\n\nRead next: GeForce Game Ready Driver Installation can’t continue.",

It’s been a busy week for us here at ETtech breaking some important stories around the quick-commerce sector.On Thursday, my colleagues Apoorva and Soumyajit wrote about how getting a spot on quick commerce platforms has become a challenge for direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands, which are coughing up 40-45% in commissions to apps such as Blinkit, Zepto and Swiggy Instamart.This is reminiscent of the early days of ecommerce boom when smaller sellers would jostle to onboard Amazon and Flipkart.On top of commissions, brands that we spoke to also flagged a constant push from category managers to boost ad spends on a platform.It’s no surprise, given quick-commerce platforms are betting big on advertising revenues to contribute substantially to their toplines. HSBC Global Research expects Blinkit’s ad revenues to grow fourfold from $60 million in FY24 to $240 million in FY27.Last week, we also wrote about how quick-commerce platforms are increasingly adding non-grocery product categories such as electronics, home appliances, beauty and personal care and apparel, in what are traditionally ‘ecommerce’ categories.But the ‘quick commerce-to-ecommerce’ highway has two-way traffic – which brings us to the second important story of this week.On Friday, Samidha and Digbijay scooped the discussions held between Walmart-owned Flipkart and Zepto for a potential acquisition of the Nexus Venture Partners-backed quick commerce platform.While the talks did not reach fruition, the development sheds light on Flipkart’s ambitions to enter the quick delivery space.The company has already been working on reducing delivery timelines and is now planning an organic foray into quick commerce. According to senior ecommerce executives, delivery speed is gaining higher significance, especially for categories such as beauty and personal care, and home decor.Also read | Swiggy Merges Mall Offerings with its Quick Comm Instamart (L-R) Byju Raveendran and Arjun MohanByju’s India chief executive Arjun Mohan is leaving the troubled edtech firm in a little more than six months after taking on the role.

The Rs 600 crore fund, formerly known as 021 Capital, has also roped in Premji Invest as an LP, the people added.After releasing guidelines for online payment aggregators like Razorpay and Cashfree, the Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday issued draft rules to regulate point-of-sale payment service providers (PA-P). Companies like Innoviti Payments, Pine Labs and MSwipe will be brought under regulatory cover now.These draft norms could slow the onboarding of online merchants by as much as 90%, industry insiders said.Several new third-party payments apps on Unified Payments Interface (UPI) are being nudged by digital payments network manager National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to invest and incentivise consumers.This is primarily aimed at getting users to transact through these new platforms, in order to reduce the risk from high concentration of transactions on the PhonePe and Google Pay platforms that control around 85% market share, three companies told ET.Also read | Cred receives in-principle approval from RBI for payment aggregator business Fintech startups Groww, Zerodha, Navi are venturing into asset management , focusing on passive funds and non-metro retail investors.

        "text": "KEY\n\nTAKEAWAYS The possibility of only one interest rate cut and escalation of geopolitical tensions increases uncertainty levels for investors\n\nThe 100-day simple moving average could be the S&P 500's next support level\n\nMassive selloff in Tech stocks sends the Nasdaq Composite below its 100-day moving average\n\nWhat a difference a week makes.\n\nLast week, the stock market changed its tune from up, up, up,... to up, down, up, down. That made it feel like investors were uncertain, yet the CBOE Volatility Index ($VIX) wasn't high enough to confirm the fear. This week, the market's singing another tune emphasizing the word \"down.\" This week, the selling pressure was more dominant, especially in the Tech sector. Does this mean the bear is coming out of hibernation?\n\nThe Macro Environment\n\nWe heard comments from two Federal Reserve Presidents, John Williams and Austan Goolsbee, who left open the possibility of a rate hike. Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested interest rates could remain higher for longer. Next week, we'll get the March PCE data, and, in light of the Fed comments, it could be higher than estimates.\n\nWe'll also get the Q1 GDP, which will probably reveal the continued strength of the US economy. If the economy continues to be resilient, we may not see a rate cut this year. As of now, the stock market has priced in at least one rate cut in 2024, which is different than the four that were expected earlier in the year.\n\nIn a \"higher for longer\" interest rate environment, two events that could have intensified the selling pressure at the end of the week are:\n\nEscalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which, for the time being, have tapered.\n\nOptions expiration day, which means heavy trading volume.\n\nNobody wants to open new positions on a Friday, especially after a volatile trading week. Anything could happen over the weekend, and traders would rather be patient and wait to see if the stock market has further to fall before jumping in.\n\nThe Broader Market\n\nYou've heard the adage, \"Markets take the stairs up and the elevator down.\" You can see this play out in the charts of the broader indexes.\n\nThe S&P 500\n\nThe S&P 500 ($SPX) closed below 5,000, a significant psychological level. On the daily chart, the index broke below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and is now approaching its 100-day SMA. The last six days have been an elevator ride down and, the way the chart looks, there could be more selling next week.\n\nFIGURE 1. DAILY CHART OF THE S&P 500. Since the S&P 500 fell below its 50-day SMA, it's taken the elevator down. The index is now approaching its 100-day SMA, which could be its next support level. Will it fall below the support?Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.\n\nOn the weekly chart, the S&P 500 is above its 50-week SMA, but has three consecutive down weeks, which doesn't paint a pretty picture. Right now, it looks as if the index has further to fall.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average\n\nAfter its most recent selloff, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($INDU) is trading around a support level (December 2023 high). The daily chart below shows that even though the index closed higher on Friday, it hit resistance from its 100-day SMA.\n\nFIGURE 2. DAILY CHART OF DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ($INDU). After its elevator ride down, $INDU appears to have hit a support level and trying to reverse, which is a positive sign.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite\n\nThe Technology sector was hit hard this week. NVIDIA (NVDA) fell over 9% on Friday; Tesla (TSLA) shares continued to fall, hitting a new 52-week low; and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell over 5%.\n\nSuper Micro Computers (SMCI), which has been in the top 5 StockCharts Technical Rank (SCTR) for months, fell over 23%. The selloff was caused by the company's decision not to preannounce its earnings results as it has in the past.\n\nLooks like investors were taking their Tech stock profits. As a result of the big Tech selloff, the Nasdaq Composite is trading below its 100-day SMA (see chart below).\n\nFIGURE 3. DAILY CHART OF NASDAQ COMPOSITE. After falling below its 100-day SMA, the Nasdaq Composite could slide to its 200-day SMA. The small wick at the bottom is slightly encouraging, but next week is another week.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.\n\nWhenever there's a massive selloff, as was the case this week, investors question whether the market has hit a bottom and if it's an ideal time to open long positions. There was a little bit of that on Friday, but every time the market rallied, it met pressure from sellers and the rally fizzled. When technicals still point lower, you may want to adopt a \"wait and see\" approach before entering long positions.\n\nNobody knows what will happen next week, but tech companies will start reporting earnings, and that could lift the stock market.\n\nSome Bright Spots\n\nAfter experiencing a plunge similar to that of the broader indexes, the Financial sector is showing signs of a reversal. The daily chart of the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) below shows a possible reversal, although a series of higher highs and higher lows is needed before an uptrend can be established. XLF would need to break above.\n\nFIGURE 4. DAILY CHART OF FINANCIAL SELECT SECTOR SPDR ETF (XLF). Looks like XLF will have to overcome the resistance from its 50-day moving average before its trend reverses.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.\n\nShares of Bank of America (BAC), JP Morgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) all traded higher on Friday. WFC's stock price reached a new all-time high. Precious metals, such as gold and silver, are trading higher. As geopolitical tensions arise, investors turn to these safe-haven investments.\n\nIt was interesting to see the CBOE Volatility Index ($VIX) hit a high of 21.36, close to the 23 level it hit in October last year. But it pulled back and closed at 18.71. The higher volatility could have been because of options expiration.\n\nIf you look at the chart of the Nasdaq Composite, you'll see that this coincided with the October selloff in Tech stocks. Will the broader markets follow a similar path, given Tech earnings start next week? We'll have to wait and see.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis week's stock market action wasn't great, and while it's tempting to find bargains in stocks, it's best to exercise patience. Instead of chasing positions, it's an excellent time to analyze charts and observe the market's actions. This can go a long way in understanding the irrational nature of the stock market.\n\nEnd-of-Week Wrap-Up\n\nS&P 500 closes down 0.88% at 4,967.23, Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.56% at 37,986; Nasdaq Composite down 2.05% at 15,282.01\n\n$VIX up 3.94% at 18.71\n\nBest performing sector for the week: Utilities\n\nWorst performing sector for the week: Technology\n\nTop 5 Large Cap SCTR stocks: MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR); Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN); Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI); Vistra Energy Corp. (VST); Vertiv Holdings (VRT)\n\nOn the Radar Next Week\n\nQ1 2024 US GDP\n\nMarch Core PCE\n\nMarch Durable Goods Orders\n\nEarnings season is in full swing with Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Intel Corp. (INTC), and Visa (V) reporting.\n\nDisclaimer: This blog is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

If the number comes in too hot, Cramer said any market gains may prove to be short-lived. But if the number is cool, it could give most stocks a lift.\n\nHe warned that even if the market is oversold next week, the PCE index report on Friday will be where the rubber truly meets the road.\n\nOn Monday, Verizon will report its quarterly results before the market opens, and two steel companies, Nucor and Cleveland Cliffs , will report after the close. Cramer said the latter companies could be strong, noting that Nucor in particular has performed well during the aggressive rate tightening.\n\nCompanies like GM , GE Aerospace and Spotify report on Tuesday, but Cramer said Tesla is the one to watch that day. He said the electric vehicle maker had a rough quarter and noted concerns about the company's weak sales, as well as the possibility for a substantial decline in cash flow.\n\nThe fun doesn't stop there, as the embattled plane-maker Boeing reports results Wednesday morning, and the social media giant Meta will post earnings after the bell. Cramer said analysts largely agree that Meta will report rosy numbers, which means CEO Mark Zuckerberg, unlike Tesla CEO Elon Musk, will not have to pull a rabbit out of a hat.\n\nOn Thursday, Caterpillar , Merck and the tech giants Microsoft and Alphabet will release earnings. With Alphabet's business model based on advertising, Cramer warned that the company does have a tendency to perform badly at earnings time, though there could be a bright spot because of its developments in artificial intelligence.\n\nOil companies Exxon Mobil and Chevron report on Friday.\n\nIt's going to be a busy week, and Cramer said to be wary of the market and to especially watch out for the PCE index report.",

(PuTTY, or Pageant, generates a signature from a key when using it to authenticate you to an SSH server.) This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2024-31497. It was discovered by Fabian BC$umer and Marcus Brinkmann of the Ruhr University Bochum; see their write-up on the oss-security mailing list. The bad news: the effect of the vulnerability is to compromise the private key. An attacker in possession of a few dozen signed messages and the public key has enough information to recover the private key, and then forge signatures as if they were from you, allowing them to (for instance) log in to any servers you use that key for. To obtain these signatures, an attacker need only briefly compromise any server you use the key to authenticate to, or momentarily gain access to a copy of Pageant holding the key. (However, these signatures are not exposed to passive eavesdroppers of SSH connections.) Therefore, if you have a key of this type, we recommend you revoke it immediately: remove the old public key from all OpenSSH authorized_keys files, and the equivalent in other SSH servers, so that a signature from the compromised key has no value any more. Then generate a new key pair to replace it. (The problem is not with how the key was originally generated; it doesn't matter whether it came from PuTTYgen or somewhere else. What matters is whether it was ever used with PuTTY or Pageant.) The good news: the only affected key type is 521-bit ECDSA. That is, a key that appears in Windows PuTTYgen with ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 at the start of the 'Key fingerprint' box, or is described as 'NIST p521' when loaded into Windows Pageant, or has an id starting ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 in the SSH protocol or the key file. Other sizes of ECDSA, and other key algorithms, are unaffected. In particular, Ed25519 is not affected.

The ruling does not apply to all cases in which biometrics are used to unlock an electronic device but is a significant decision in an unsettled area of the law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit had to grapple with the question of \"whether the compelled use of Payne's thumb to unlock his phone was testimonial,\" the ruling in United States v. Jeremy Travis Payne said. \"To date, neither the Supreme Court nor any of our sister circuits have addressed whether the compelled use of a biometric to unlock an electronic device is testimonial.\" A three-judge panel at the 9th Circuit ruled unanimously against Payne, affirming a US District Court's denial of Payne's motion to suppress evidence.

But the most common source of battery-related fires in airplane travel is surprising: vape pens. A safety organization that tracks airline battery incidents grew so concerned that it recently flagged the vaping fire trend to the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees electronic smoking devices. On average in the United States, there are more than two reports each week of battery-related fires, smoke or similar incidents on planes or at airports, according to voluntary reporting by passenger and cargolines. How to reduce the risk of in-flight battery fires Don’t pack e-cigarettes or other battery-powered devices in your checked luggage. Airlines tell you this, but people may not know the rules or forget that they packed a vape pen or portable battery in a suitcase that gets gate-checked. The risk is that no one will see a fire that starts in the baggage hold before it grows out of control. Don’t charge vape pens on board the plane. It’s not allowed. Take that rule seriously. There’s typically a higher fire risk when a battery is charging. Last year, a Spirit Airlines flight to Orlando made an emergency landing because of a fire from a vape pen that was charging in an overhead bin. A reminder: You’re not allowed to smoke on planes. That includes e-cigarettes. Tell a flight attendant or other personnel immediately if you see smoke or fire. Airline crews have special training and fire containment bags for battery-powered gadgets. https://s2.washingtonpost.com/camp-rw/?trackId=596b22969bbc0f403f8bcc25&s=66229c2c847347087352364b&linknum=2&linktot=37 ------------------------------ Date: Tue, 16 Apr 2024 14:22:53 -0700 From: Steve Bacher <sebmb1 () verizon net> Subject: Are Flying Cars Finally Here?

(The Washington Post) Boddy immediately bought an Edgertronic on eBay. He also had a crucial insight about how to use it. Camera data could help players experiment with new pitch grips and refine their swings, and the avalanche of statistical data could confirm the outcomes. But to revolutionize player performance — to get athletes to really understand what they needed to do — the two had to converge in simple and elegant software. And the means of that convergence was artificial intelligence. I’ve spoken to a lot of people about AI, and there’s an awkward point in almost every conversation where we both admit we don’t know exactly what AI is. In fairness, it can be a lot of things. There’s no fixed definition. But people are pretty assertive about the money they expect to make from it, and I’m an AI columnist, so it’d be nice not to have to talk about the benefits of this technology in the vague way people talk about, I dunno, Herbalife?

The combination of AI/HFT will completely revolutionize Wall Street, because an AI/HFT 'analyst' can respond within micro- or milli-seconds, rather than within days. You may recall that AlphaGo revolutionized the game of Go, by playing with itself thousands upon thousands of games, enabling the creation of new strategies never before known to human Go players. Similarly, an AI/HFT (legal) 'person' could learn about trading patterns, first as a completely passive study of past trading activity, followed by a gentle introduction to active trading in small volumes, completely hedged by the SPX/QQQ indices, followed by an acceleration of volume into large scale activities. With risk minimized by constant hedging, such an AI/HFT bot could eventually figure out non- (in-?) human strategies that might make very little on each transaction, but could coordinate the transactions over a large number of stocks/bonds/commodities and world-wide exchanges in every time zones to beat most -- if not all -- human traders. At some point, the 'coupon clip machine' would no longer have any need for outside investors, but would have accumulated enough capital to trade only for its own account. If it were part of a non-profit, e.g., a university endowment fund (Harvard??), then it wouldn't even have to worry about taxes. Bostrom's 'paper clip machine' would then be outclassed by this 'coupon clip machine', which cared nothing about humans but only about 'shareholders' such as itself. I suspect that such coupon clip machine(s) are already in training (Simons??), and may already be making outsized profits -- at least enough to pay a larger premium for whatever nVidia boxes they need than anyone else can afford to pay. ------------------------------ Date: Wed, 17 Apr 2024 09:50:51 +0300 From: Amos Shapir <amos083 () gmail com> Subject: Re: AI chatbots spread falsehoods about the EU elections, report finds (RISKS-34.17) For an application whose main job is gathering and presenting information, results which are factually false should be considered a serious bug.

        "text": "NEW YORK, April 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended mixed on Friday, as the investors reacted to the geopolitical conflicts and sticky inflation.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 211.02 points, or 0.56 percent, to 37,986.4, lifted by a rally of more than 6 percent in American Express following upbeat earnings. The S&P 500 sank 43.89 points, or 0.88 percent, to 4,967.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 319.49 points, or 2.05 percent, to 15,282.01, notching its longest losing streak in more than a year. Both S&P 500 and Nasdaq were poised for their sixth straight negative days, streaks not seen for either since October 2022.\n\nSix of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in green, with utilities and financials leading the gainers by going up 1.47 percent and 1.35 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, technology and communication services led the laggards by dropping 3.08 percent and 2.03 percent, respectively.\n\nChicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee noted on Friday that efforts to reduce inflation have hit a roadblock this year, aligning with other U.S. central bankers who have shifted away from anticipating imminent interest rate cuts. \"Given the strength of the labor market and progress on easing inflation seen over a longer arc, I believe the Fed's current restrictive monetary policy is appropriate. I think we have to recalibrate and we have to wait and see,\" he said.\n\nThe prevailing belief at the Fed is that maintaining higher interest rates for an extended period is necessary to counter persistent inflationary pressures. The central bank has maintained its policy rate within the 5.25-5.50 percent range since last July. Previously, Goolsbee and many other policymakers believed that at least three rate cuts would be needed this year.\n\nMeanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index, known as the \"fear index\" of the U.S. stock market, rose to 21.36 points during the trading session, marking the first time it has surpassed the 20-point threshold since Oct. 30, 2023.\n\nDespite this, some argue that increased volatility is justified after a period where the S&P 500 surged by as much as 28 percent from its lows in October. \"In hindsight the market was a little overbought a few weeks ago and there was a little bit too much optimism, exuberance, FOMO (fear of missing out),\" said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager for Rational Equity Armor Fund. \"You put some challenges in its way, such as, rising interest rates and a potential war ... it makes a lot of sense to back off,\" he said.\n\nOn the corporate front, despite reporting quarterly earnings that surpassed expectations both in revenue and profit, Netflix experienced a significant decline of over 9 percent. This drop occurred even as the streaming service noted a 16 percent increase in subscribers compared to the previous year. Netflix announced that it would cease reporting paid memberships beginning in 2025.\n\nIn the tech sector, chip stocks like Nvidia and Super Micro Computer faced mounting pressure during afternoon trading. This trend indicated a notable shift as investors moved away from the sector that had previously led the bull market. Specifically, artificial intelligence-focused companies like Nvidia and Super Micro Computer saw declines of 10 percent and 23 percent, respectively. Nvidia's performance marked its worst day since March 2020.",

If you’re a Valorant fan in need of a new rig, then iBUYPOWER’s latest options may be what you’re looking for. Not only will they probably be suitable for your desired style, but they should be able to handle your gaming needs from a performance standpoint.\n\nThere are two rigs in this new lineup and both use the Scale case that iBUYPOWER offers. They’re also both relatively affordable and are on sale as of this week. You can pick up the new Scale models starting at $899.99 from Best Buy or bump up to the $1,299.99 model which comes with more powerful specs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former comes equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 7600 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and an AMD Radeon RX 7600 GPU. There’s also a 1TB SSD for game storage, and plenty of fans and venting for cooling. One thing to keep in mind is that neither of these PCs is going to be your top-of-the-line rig built for bleeding-edge performance with maxed-out graphics. The price should give that away. However, iBUYPOWER does build a solid gaming PC and these aren’t expected to be any different. As long as your expectations on what the components can deliver are in check.\n\nIf you don’t mind paying a little extra, you can for the other Scale model that comes with 32GB of RAM, an AMD Ryzen 7 7700 CPU, and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti GPU. Storage space is the same at 1TB.\n\niBUYPOWER Valorant PCs feature styling based on the VCT Americas\n\nIn truth, the styling is pretty minimal and it doesn’t encompass the whole case. But that’s precisely what some people are going to like about it. There’s a little VCT Americas bar that drapes across the front bottom corner and then a larger panel across the bottom side of the glass. There are also matching orange feet on the underside of the case. And the whole thing comes together with some VCT-themed lighting. You can change the lighting, however.\n\nThe Scale rigs come with ample clearance for swapping out parts when it comes time to upgrade. For instance, let’s say you feel like upgrading to a more powerful GPU in a year or two. You should have no trouble fitting any of the latest cards in there. These PCs also support coolers up to 360mm so you’ve got room for lots of parts variety.",

UBS suggested \"some of the demand tailwind is attributable to hyperscale customers tapering growth on AI server spend and diverting capital to traditional compute over the next couple of quarters\" before Nvidia's (NVDA) Blackwell platform expected to ship later in 2024.\n\nIntel has struggled to keep up with peers like Nvidia and AMD amid the AI boom. The company recently unveiled its latest AI chip, the Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, which Intel claims outperforms Nvidia's H100.\n\nCFRA analyst Angelo Zino told Investopedia that his firm doesn't view \"Intel being a threat for Nvidia\" in the near future, but noted that \"it's another option out there\" for customers. The \"long-term story for Intel continues to be on the foundry side of things\" because the company is not producing \"leading-edge AI chips\" and has \"clearly fallen behind,\" and is now playing a difficult game of catch-up with its competitors, Zino added.\n\n\n\nBusiness Spotlight: Foundry Business\n\nIntel recently announced a new reporting structure under which it will report financials for its foundry or semiconductor manufacturing business separately from its other segments as part of the company's efforts to operate its foundry business as a more independent unit.\n\nThe new structure disclosed widening losses in its foundry business. The company also will provide foundry revenue in its first-quarter report, which could allow investors to gauge key metrics for the semiconductor manufacturing business.\n\nBank of America (BAC) analysts said that Intel's foundry business' ability to be profitable in a competitive environment plays a role, among other factors, in the bull and bear cases for the stock.\n\nUBS analysts wrote that Intel's foundry losses are \"not entirely unexpected,\" but confirmed that the chipmaker's costs are higher than competitors.\n\nThey said that UBS \"remain[s] optimistic that profitability will improve as the company transitions away from structural cost challenges,\" but noted that they are \"cognizant that most of the profitability improvement only materializes in the 2027+ timeframe.\"\n\nIntel shares have lost almost 32% so far this year, with shares closing at $34.20 on Friday.",

        "title": "Manor Lords FAQ: Release date, Xbox, Early Access, price, and other questions answered",
        "text": "If you enjoy medieval games, city-builders, and commanding units in strategic battles, you'll likely fall in love with one of 2024's most highly anticipated new releases: Manor Lords. Developed entirely by Slavic Magic's solo developer Greg Styczeń over the course of many years, it's a passion project that's resonating with thousands of gamers worldwide. Right now, it's the most wishlisted game on Steam, surpassing other huge titles like Hades 2 and Hollow Knight: Silksong.\n\nThe pre-launch hype for Manor Lords is amazing to see — and as its Early Access draws near, players undoubtedly have tons of questions about what to expect from the game, what features it will have, what platforms they'll be able to play it on, and more. To answer them, I've put together this comprehensive FAQ, and will update it frequently as new information about Manor Lords comes from Slavic Magic and publisher Hooded Horse.\n\nFor a complete overview of everything you need to know about Manor Lords, including its gameplay, release date, Early Access length, and more, read on.\n\nWhat is Manor Lords?\n\nBest answer: Manor Lords is a medieval city-builder game that primarily emphasizes development and management, though there are strategic Total War-style battles to fight whenever the situation at hand calls for war. It's being developed by Slavic Magic's solo developer Greg Styczeń, who's been working on the game for several years. Notably, when it releases it will be in Early Access.\n\nManor Lords is an ambitious project Slavic Magic solo developer Greg Styczeń has been working on for years, and is best described as what you'd get if you threw a city-builder, a farming simulator, and the strategic battles of Total War into a blender and then set the resulting game in medieval Europe. It places a greater emphasis on city development and management than on warfare — the developer stressed this in a new pre-release blog post — though you'll still have to take up arms when driven to do so by aggressing forces or the desire to conquest.\n\nSuccess in Manor Lords largely depends on your ability to grow, hunt, and harvest the resources you need from your land, with things like soil fertility, animal population density, and the health of forests directly affected by where and how you set up your operations and expand. These factors, along with road placement and established trade routes, have a significant impact on how your settlements grow over time — just as they did in real towns and villages of the era.\n\nYour management skills will also be put to the test by challenging obstacles such as seasonal climate changes, instances of inclement weather, and sickness, among others. These force you to decide where to allocate your resources carefully, and keep you on your toes even when harvests are bountiful. Using too much timber when you don't need to, for example, might leave you without the wood you desperately need in wintertime.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nHarsh weather is one of the many threats you'll have to deal with in Manor Lords. (Image credit: Slavic Magic)\n\nThese types of lasting consequences extend to Manor Lords' period-accurate combat systems, too; every man-at-arms you lose in battle is a farmer or tradesman you lose at home, weakening your economic stability. Because of that, choosing your tactics and positioning wisely and ensuring your troops are well-fed, adequately trained and equipped, and in high spirits is paramount.\n\nNotably, Manor Lords is launching in Early Access, with Styczeń planning to add additional features and content to the game over time and make adjustments based on community feedback.\n\n\"This will be an early access release. Yes, it must be disappointing, but I think it's the right choice. It's my first serious game and not only some stuff is still unfinished, but I bet you guys will ask me to change some things you don't necessarily like,\" he wrote in the aforementioned blog post. \"But I want to pursue an open development strategy of a back and forth between me and you, I think it worked great for the game so far (I'm comparing to times where there wasn't even a testing group and I was developing in a bubble).\"\n\nBest answer: Manor Lords is scheduled to release on Steam, GOG, and the Microsoft Store in Early Access on April 26.\n\nA small army preparing for battle in Manor Lords. (Image credit: Hooded Horse)\n\nManor Lords has been in development for a long, long time, but now it's only a week or so away from being in our hands — barring any sudden delays, of course. Specifically, the game's Early Access launch is scheduled for April 26, 2024. When it releases, it will be available on Steam, GOG, and the Microsoft Store.\n\nManor Lords' publisher Hooded Horse noted that it usually releases its games between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. PT, so it's likely that the medieval city-builder will be made available in the morning. There will also be a countdown clock visible in Steam once the release date draws nearer, and Hooded Horse plans to publish a release times map with time zone conversions, too (I'll add it to this section once it's posted).\n\nHow long will Manor Lords Early Access last?\n\nBest answer: Slavic Magic plans to keep Manor Lords in Early Access for \"around a year,\" though this might change based on the feedback the community gives for the game.\n\nA small Manor Lords village in the midst of autumn. (Image credit: Slavic Magic)\n\nLike many games that release in Early Access, Manor Lords is expected to be in this work-in-progress state for about a year or so. Developer Slavic Magic confirmed this in the Early Access section of the game's description on Steam: \"We might remain in Early Access for around a year, but that might change depending on how the design develops with player feedback.”\n\nTherefore, you can tentatively expect Manor Lords' full release in Spring 2025, though it might come later (or sooner) depending on the feedback given by the community. This is core to Greg Styczeń's pursuit of \"an open development strategy of a back and forth between me and you,\" which is a common reason many games begin life as Early Access titles.\n\nWill Manor Lords get a roadmap? Roadmaps give fans an idea of what types of content additions they can expect and when they'll come, but it sounds like we won't get one for Manor Lords for a long time. That's because developer Greg Styczeń confirmed in his pre-release blog post on Steam that he has no plans to make a roadmap right now, as he wants to \"adopt the philosophy of 'listen, verify, implement'\" before working on a feature fans may not want. However, that same post does confirm that the first month of patches for the game will be for \"bug fixes and polish,\" with Hooded Horse and Styczeń choosing what content to focus on developing after gathering feedback during that time.\n\nHow much does Manor Lords cost?\n\nBest answer: Manor Lords' price hasn't been confirmed yet, but it's expected to be around $30-40. Something that's been stated, though, is that the game's price may increase during its Early Access period as more content and features are added.\n\nCitizens conversing in a city in Manor Lords. (Image credit: Slavic Magic)\n\nMost games are usually pretty straightforward with their pricing ahead of their launch, but Manor Lords is an exception to this trend. Even though its Early Access launch is just a week away, we still don't have any concrete information about how much the game will cost. With that said, it's expected to be around $30-40, so keep that in mind.\n\nSomething we do know, however, is that Slavic Magic and Hooded Horse might increase Manor Lords' price during the Early Access period \"as additional content and features are added.\" This was revealed in the Early Access section of the game's Steam page, though whether or not this actually happens is something only time will tell.\n\nManor Lords (PC) Build your medieval towns and grow them into bustling cities. You'll need to take the weather into account and fight off enemy forces in order to create a thriving economy, but that's all part of the fun in this ambitious strategy game. See at: Microsoft Store | GOG | CDKeys (Steam) | Steam\n\nIs Manor Lords coming to Xbox?\n\nBest answer: Yes, Manor Lords is coming to Xbox in addition to Steam, GOG, and the Microsoft Store. However, it won't be available on Microsoft's consoles for the Early Access launch, so you'll have to wait a while to play it if you're an Xbox player.\n\nBattles in Manor Lords are highly strategic and have lasting consequences. (Image credit: Hooded Horse)\n\nManor Lords looks to be one of 2024's best PC games, which naturally has many players on Xbox curious if they'll be able to play the game, too. Ultimately, there's good news and bad news; the good news is that Manor Lords is indeed coming to Microsoft's consoles, but the bad news is that it won't be available on them when it launches into Early Access on April 26.\n\nWith that said, Xbox fans may not have to wait long to play Slavic Magic's exciting city management game. In Manor Lords' release date trailer, it was said that it would be \"coming soon to consoles.\" Then, in a preview post on Xbox Wire, Microsoft noted that the title would arrive on its consoles \"shortly after\" its Early Access launch. That wording makes it sound like it could arrive on Xbox in just a few months, though nothing's been confirmed yet.\n\nIs Manor Lords coming to Game Pass?\n\nBest answer: Yes, Manor Lords is coming to Game Pass. Specifically, it will be available on the Microsoft Store through PC Game Pass when it launches on April 26, and when it releases on Xbox consoles, it will be playable on Xbox Game Pass as well. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will give you access to Manor Lords on both platforms.\n\nA wide shot of a large city in Manor Lords. (Image credit: Slavic Magic)\n\nMicrosoft's buffet-style Game Pass service allows players to check out many games without buying them directly, and with Manor Lords so close to launching, plenty of subscribers are curious if they'll be able to play it through their membership. Luckily, they will, as Manor Lords will be available to play with PC Game Pass once it's released on April 26.\n\nOnce the city-builder arrives on Xbox, users with the console-specific version of the service, Xbox Game Pass, will be able to play Manor Lords on it as well. Notably, you can access the game on both PC and Xbox with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, the best tier of Game Pass that includes the option to stream your games over the cloud.\n\nDoes Manor Lords have multiplayer or co-op?\n\nBest answer: Manor Lords has been designed to be a single-player game, so there won't be multiplayer or co-op play of any kind when it launches. Developer Slavic Magic also doesn't have any plans to develop any right now.\n\nPositioning your forces intelligently is crucial for success in Manor Lord's combat. (Image credit: Hooded Horse)\n\nManor Lords has been designed from the ground up as a \"refined single-player experience,\" so when it launches, it won't have multiplayer features, content, or modes of any kind. That means you won't be able to develop your city in co-op with friends, and you won't be able to conquer another player's kingdom in PvP, either.\n\nSlavic Magic has also gone on record to say that there are \"no multiplayer or cooperative modes planned at the moment,\" so I wouldn't expect one unless the developer says otherwise at some point. If fans want it enough, though, there's always a chance multiplayer could be considered in the future.\n\nWhat are Manor Lords' minimum system requirements?\n\nSeveral large homes created through Manor Lords' city-building mechanics. (Image credit: Hooded Horse)\n\nWe've got a full article on Manor Lords' required specs that includes instructions on how to check your PC's hardware, but I've also listed the minimum and recommended specs for the game here. You'll find them below:\n\nManor Lords minimum system requirements\n\nRequires a 64-bit processor and operating system\n\nOS: Windows 10 (64-bit)\n\nWindows 10 (64-bit) Processor: Intel Core i5-4670 (quad-core) / AMD FX-Series FX-4350 (quad-core)\n\nIntel Core i5-4670 (quad-core) / AMD FX-Series FX-4350 (quad-core) Memory: 8 GB RAM\n\n8 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 (2 GB) / AMD Radeon RX-460 (4 GB)\n\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 (2 GB) / AMD Radeon RX-460 (4 GB) DirectX: Version 12\n\nVersion 12 Storage: 16 GB available space\n\nManor Lords recommended specs\n\nRequires a 64-bit processor and operating system\n\nOS: Windows 10 (64-bit)\n\nWindows 10 (64-bit) Processor: Intel Core i5-7600 (quad-core) / AMD® Ryzen 3 2200G (quad-core)\n\nIntel Core i5-7600 (quad-core) / AMD® Ryzen 3 2200G (quad-core) Memory: 12 GB RAM\n\n12 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce® GTX 1060 (6 GB) / AMD Radeon RX 580 (8 GB)\n\nNVIDIA GeForce® GTX 1060 (6 GB) / AMD Radeon RX 580 (8 GB) DirectX: Version 12\n\nVersion 12 Storage: 16 GB available space\n\nUltimately, these specs should be very easy to meet as long as you've got a modern computer — the recommended CPUs and GPUs are nearly a decade old, after all. The only thing that might reduce your performance a bit is not having 12GB of memory or more (16-32GB is generally considered the standard for gaming PCs these days), but 8GB is enough to meet the minimum required spec, so as long as you have that, you'll be fine.\n\nManor Lords trailers\n\nIn this final section, I've embedded all of Manor Lords' different trailers in one place for easy viewing.",

        "text": "Key Takeaways The S&P 500 tumbled 0.9% on Friday, April 19, 2024, closing below 5,000 for the first time since February as declines persisted in the tech sector.\n\nSuper Micro Computer shares fell as the data storage provider opted not to preannounce its quarterly results, raising concerns about its success in leveraging AI.\n\nParamount Global shares soared amid reports Sony is in talks with Apollo Global Management to make a possible joint bid for the media giant.\n\nMajor U.S. equities indexes were mixed on Friday, closing out a week that saw stocks come under pressure as rate-cut expectations receded and investors reacted to a mixed bag of earnings reports.\n\nThe S&P 500 dropped 0.9%, closing below the 5,000 level for the first time since February. Persistent declines in the tech sector dragged on the Nasdaq, which slipped 2.1%. The Dow closed in positive territory for the second straight day, with strength in financials and health care helping lift the blue-chip index 0.6%.\n\nShares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) plunged 23.1%, the steepest loss among S&P 500 stocks. The server and data storage provider failed to make an announcement ahead of its fiscal third-quarter results. Wells Fargo analysts pointed out that Super Micro has a track record of indicating positive results ahead of time, so the lack of a preannouncement lowers the likelihood of blowout earnings driven by artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities.\n\nBeyond the downdraft for Super Micro Computer, a less optimistic AI outlook pressured other stocks that have benefitted from their connections to the technology. Shares of AI chip behemoth Nvidia (NVDA) dropped 10.0%. Fellow semiconductor stocks Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Micron Technology (MU), and Broadcom (AVGO), and fell 5.4%, 4.6%, and 4.3%, respectively.\n\nShares of Netflix (NFLX) tumbled 9.1% after the streaming platform released weaker-than-expected revenue guidance. Although the company exceeded revenue and profit forecasts and achieved strong subscriber growth, impacts from the crackdown on password sharing and the lower-cost advertising tier remain uncertain. Netflix also announced it would stop reporting quarterly subscriber numbers starting in 2025.\n\nParamount Global (PARA) shares logged Friday's top performance in the S&P 500, soaring 13.4%. The gains followed reports that Sony Group's (SONY) studio division was in talks with Apollo Global Management about a possible joint bid for Paramount. The two suitors have yet to submit a formal offer, as Paramount remains in exclusive merger negotiations with Skydance Media.\n\n\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) shares added 6.2% after the financial services firm reported better-than-expected sales and profits for the first quarter. Unlike numerous peers in the financial sector, the payment card issuer beat forecasts with its net interest income for the quarter. According to the CEO, American Express has been successful in attracting high-spending customers with good credit quality.\n\nShares of Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) gained 5.9% after the Cincinnati-based lender's first-quarter revenue and earnings exceeded forecasts. A drop in adjusted expenses during the quarter suggested that the regional bank's management has seen some success in its initiatives to increase efficiency.\n\n",

        "text": "This is a routine jawboning case. Facebook and Twitter allegedly shut down Hart’s accounts for disseminating COVID misinformation. Hart claims he was targeted by the government. The district court dismissed the case (1, 2).\n\nThe Ninth Circuit affirms in a brief memo opinion. The court says simply: “As private companies, Twitter and Facebook are not subject to the Constitution’s constraints.” (Cite to O’Handley). Hart alleged Twitter and Facebook engaged in joint actions with the government. However, “Facebook and Twitter’s rights to moderate his posts arise from their user agreements with Hart, not from any right conferred by the federal government….Hart has not shown that the Federal Defendants are responsible for Facebook and Twitter’s moderation of his posts.” Hart cited 10 interactions between the government and the services, but none of them referenced him, and the interactions showed the “the federal officials sought to inform Facebook and Twitter of what the government considered to be misinformation about COVID-19.”\n\nAs I said, standard jawboning stuff. There are only three mild points of interest in this ruling.\n\nFirst, Judge Rawlinson concurred only in the result but did not explain her differences with the opinion. I’m not sure what that’s about.\n\nSecond, in the next couple of months, the Supreme Court will issue an opinion in the Murthy jawboning case, which could change the rules for this and other cases. The court proceeded anyway: “We agree with the parties that we need not stay consideration of this appeal pending the Supreme Court’s decision in Murthy.” From my perspective, the panel didn’t see any reason to wait because Hart’s case was so weak that they probably couldn’t imagine any way the Supreme Court ruling could make it meritorious.\n\nThird, this is at least the SIXTH time in the past 18 months that the Ninth Circuit has rejected an online jawboning case. (The five others: O’Handley, Huber, Doe v. Google, Kennedy v. Warren, Rogalinski). It’s a reminder of the stakes in the Murthy case. Today, online jawboning cases are easy dismissals (except in the Fifth Circuit, which has tacitly declared judicial independence from the union). However, if the Supreme Court’s Murthy opinion gives any hope to plaintiffs, the resulting litigation tsunami will be enormous.\n\nCase Citation: Hart v. Facebook, Inc., 2024 WL 1693355 (9th Cir.

For the past three years, IEEE Spectrum has read the whole damn thing and pulled out a selection of charts that sum up the current state of AI.”\n\nThe Next Frontier for Brain Implants Is Artificial Vision\n\nEmily Mullin | Wired\n\n“Elon Musk’s Neuralink and others are developing devices that could provide blind people with a crude sense of sight. …’This is not about getting biological vision back,’ says Philip Troyk, a professor of biomedical engineering at Illinois Tech, who’s leading the study Bussard is in. ‘This is about exploring what artificial vision could be.'”\n\nDIGITAL MEDIA\n\nMicrosoft’s VASA-1 Can Deepfake a Person With One Photo and One Audio Track\n\nBenj Edwards | Ars Technica\n\n“On Tuesday, Microsoft Research Asia unveiled VASA-1, an AI model that can create a synchronized animated video of a person talking or singing from a single photo and an existing audio track. In the future, it could power virtual avatars that render locally and don’t require video feeds—or allow anyone with similar tools to take a photo of a person found online and make them appear to say whatever they want.”\n\nMeta Is Already Training a More Powerful Successor to Llama 3\n\nWill Knight | Wired\n\n“On Thursday morning, Meta released its latest artificial intelligence model, Llama 3, touting it as the most powerful to be made open source so that anyone can use it. The same afternoon, Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, said an even more powerful successor to Llama is in the works. He suggested it could potentially outshine the world’s best closed AI models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini.”\n\nIntel Reveals World’s Biggest ‘Brain-Inspired’ Neuromorphic Computer\n\nMatthew Sparkes | New Scientist\n\n“Hala Point contains 1.15 billion artificial neurons across 1152 Loihi 2 achips, and is capable of 380 trillion synaptic operations per second. Mike Davies at Intel says that despite this power it occupies just six racks in a standard server case—a space similar to that of a microwave oven.

        "text": "Pin 2 2 Shares\n\nIT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping, shopping, shopping, often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. But what if the answer isn’t a plant sometimes, but a pot or a sculpture or some other non-living elements strategically placed?\n\nStephen Procter, a ceramist specializing in art for the garden, has walked through many a landscape with prospective clients, helping to figure out the roles such pieces could play.\n\nStephen, who is Vermont-based, has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. His work has been displayed at public gardens such as Blithewold in Rhode Island and The Mount, Edith Wharton’s home in the Berkshires of Massachusetts. He helped me think about what else besides plants can help the garden hang together, and how.\n\nRead along as you listen to the April 22, 2024 edition of my public-radio show and podcast using the player below. You can subscribe to all future editions on Apple Podcasts (iTunes) or Spotify (and browse my archive of podcasts here).\n\nsculptural pots in the garden, with stephen procter\n\nMargaret Roach: Hi, Stephen. I first got to know of your work thanks to the Instagram algorithm [view his account].\n\nStephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram.\n\nMargaret: I know, whatever. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever, friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends, follow you there. And so I kept getting shown your posts of your vessels, your pots, and then so I contacted you and we worked together on a “New York Times” garden column together recently. And since those conversations we had for that story, I keep looking around my garden with a different eye, I have to say, thanks to you. So: thanks to you.\n\nStephen: [Laughter.] I’m so happy to hear that.\n\nMargaret: Yeah. So your pots are not just flower pots, neither in scale nor in purpose. Tell us how big they range and what the intention, what their intention initially … [Laughter.] How did this happen? You started making these big pots for gardens, didn’t you? About 20 years ago.\n\nStephen: I sometimes wonder that myself. So, so many questions you asked all at once there. I’ll try to take them up one at a time. My zone is sort of 3 to 5-1/2 feet tall for finished pieces, the upward limitation being my tolerance for risk and the height of my custom-built kiln. And it’s funny, I’ve been to several pottery events recently, and I don’t really feel like a potter, even though I work in clay.\n\nPeople say potter or pottery, and their mind conjures something quite different from what I do. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. My approach is essentially sculptural. When I sit down at the wheel, I am thinking about a rough sense of scale and form and it unfolds over several days as I’m throwing. Once in a while, I’m working with a jig if I want to replicate a form that I’ve loved before. And I wound up putting them in gardens because they’re too big for most homes.\n\nMargaret: [Laughter.] Yeah, they are. They are. So again, I said they’re not flower pots. We don’t put soil and plants in them, although they do have a hole, a drainage hole in the bottom. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. But they’re functional. And I know that when we did the “Times” story, you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of, we’ll say discussion, but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter], about functional ceramics, functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is, whether it’s art or not.\n\nStephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative.\n\nMargaret: Yeah, decorative. So yours are decorative, but it’s not that they’re not functional. Correct?\n\nStephen: I think of them as functional in that they inspire people, they define spaces, they announce significance. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level, if you will. It that’s not too big a claim.\n\nMargaret: Well, but I think the garden is, I mean to me, what else are we doing out there? It’s not just outdoor decorating, is it? I mean, hopefully it elevates us and the space.\n\nStephen: Absolutely. And I feel like a piece like this can really focus and amplify that effect in a certain way. The way, especially it, in a certain sense, reorganizes the energy around it in an interesting way, and certainly reorganizes the visual field when something like this enters the garden.\n\nMargaret: Yeah. Well, when we did the “Times” story, you cited a poem which by Wallace Stevens, whose work I’d read, but I didn’t know the poem “Anecdote of the Jar.” I don’t know if you want to tell us about it, but it was beautiful.\n\nStephen: Sadly, I can’t recite the poem. I haven’t read it that recently. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. The line I particularly love is “It made the slovenly wilderness surround that hill.” And he talks about how it reorganizes all the relationships of the things surrounding it.\n\nMargaret: Right. And so from that, I wrote down one line I remember, “The wilderness rose up to it and sprawled around it, no longer wild.”\n\nStephen: Oh, I love that line.\n\nMargaret: And so there’s that sort of, there’s the thing that’s man-made in the wild space, and the two of them are changed a little bit from the relationship, yeah?\n\nStephen: I feel like they enter a conversation of sorts, between the man-made and the natural. And one instance of that that’s maybe even a little more intense than the garden, which is already cultivated, is when clients choose to site a piece of mine in relation to a large stone or a large rock, where there’s this huge sort of primal presence of the stone conversing with the tamed stone of the stoneware vessel. It becomes a very interesting conversation, to my mind.\n\nMargaret: Right. Now, I said in the introduction that yours, because they’re this very high-fired stoneware, they can stay outside all four seasons. And clearly a lot of… We’re sort of trying to inspire people in this conversation we’re having today on the podcast, just to consider sculptural elements in the garden that can do the jobs we’re going to talk about. But some of them aren’t going to be four-season because they’re not going to be weatherproof, so to speak. And so that has to be taken into consideration, not just the placement and the scale and so forth, but also the durability. And yours can do that.\n\nStephen: Yes. I use what potters call high-fire stoneware for exactly that reason. It’s completely impervious to moisture. To help people understand the difference, I sometimes use the comparison of think of the material your dinnerware is made of, as opposed to the material a terracotta pot is made of. This is more like the dinnerware. And I often like to go on and joke that added advantage, it’s also microwavable and dishwasher-safe.\n\nMargaret: [Laughter.] Yeah, if you can haul the 250 pounds of clay into the house and shove it in the microwave. But in other words, what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element, a non-plant element of another substance, but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof). So that’s just to be kept in mind. So besides the wilderness rising up to it and being changed, and it changing the wilderness, people kind of rise up to it, too, when they see one of these, don’t they [laughter]?\n\nStephen: I love watching people interact with these pots. I think of the pots as creatures of sorts, and apparently other people do, too. They approach them and they stroke them or they pet them or they hug them. There’s a lot of physical interaction that’s very unselfconscious, and I see that happening and I always feel like, oh, the pots work; whatever its mysterious work is is happening in this interaction.\n\nMargaret: So let’s talk about some of the work and some of the roles that a sculptural element like one of your large vessels can play, and how do we figure it out, where to place such a statement.\n\nSo if someone contacts you and says, so I’m thinking I want something, but I don’t know what or where, you sometimes go and go on a walk with them, I guess, or do it photographically or whatever. But I mean, what’s the beginning of that process, of that exploration process?\n\nI mean, I always say one of the most important things about garden design, and I’m no garden designer I just only know some basic principles, is don’t forget, besides walking around outside, don’t forget to go inside and look out the window. Because I also want to have the sense of the outdoors from indoors, because I’m indoors a lot, right? So I don’t know if you take that into consideration, like the placement, not just from the outdoor experience, but from key views within the living space.\n\nStephen: Absolutely, I do. And it can make a big impact, oddly to an indoor room almost as much as to an outdoor space, the way it’s framed by a window or beckons someone to go outdoors and be in its presence. It’s a wonderful thing. And particularly for people, I just heard recently from a garden designer who lives up in Central Vermont, Judith Irven, who was talking about she and her husband, in the winter sit in their sunroom that faces the hillside where they placed a pot of mine. So they enjoy it all year round from indoors in the winter, and it’s a long winter in the mountains where they are, and watch how it plays with the snow as it comes and goes, and the wind.\n\nMargaret: And I think some of this people may think, oh, right, I’ve used sometimes a pair of, well-placed chairs, is that type of thing. Even in the winter I leave out certain things and I have one pair that’s way up on the hill at the edge of a meadow, and especially in the snow, there’s just something so, it’s like, “Ooh, someday I’ll be going back up there and sitting there in the fairer days.” Do you know what I mean? There’s just that.\n\nStephen: Yes, exactly.\n\nMargaret: Yeah, that come hither kind of, but not right now, kind of conversation that I’m having looking out the window at it [laughter]. So let’s talk about some of the things. So someone says, I think I want something, but I don’t know what, and I need your advice. And so what are some of the roles, you go wander around or whatever with people? What are some of the things that this type of a statement can do, this kind of a vessel or sculpture can do in a garden?\n\nStephen: I’ll start with some of the more obvious things it can do. And that is to reinforce the structure of the garden that’s already there. The visual destination at the end of a straight path. Or the sort of, I think, of “greeter function” as you move from one room or area of the garden to another, almost like some people might use a granite fence post or something like that. That is a very interesting way to announce that articulation of the structure.\n\nAt the inside bend of a path, along a garden pathway, is another interesting way to create of an arm to swing around [laughter], if you will, as you’re moving down the path. So some of those ways that are, I think of, as classically reinforcing the bones of the garden already.\n\nAnd then there are more interesting and, I think, more arguably subtle ways of using them. An organic form that’s partially occluded by a large bush or something like that, and reveals only part of itself, creates this sense of mystery and intrigue and what is that? And a different way of drawing somebody to it, sort of by being coy as opposed to by being so fully present.\n\nMargaret: So it’s not like in a formal garden, like in a parterre or a boxwood four-square kind of planting, where there’s a pad with a plinth in the middle and it’s this perfect geometry, and this vessel is fully exposed in the midst of all this other formality and geometry. It’s not like that. You’re saying it could actually kind of be nestled in and not fully exposed, and that’s almost more exciting in some ways.\n\nStephen: Well, exciting in a different way. And both work beautifully. I just had a conversation yesterday with someone who has exactly that very highly structured, it’s a very geometric herb garden, and she’s looking for a tall vessel to sort of anchor the center of that, and looking for a more organic form to put near an exotic Japanese maple, which I think would be a really interesting … I mean, it’s a very different mood that’s called for in the second place. And she’s talking about a very different kind of pot to enhance that.\n\nMargaret: You were just mentioning two pots, and you didn’t necessarily say that they’d be where they’d both be seen at the same time. But when we talked for the “Times” story, you talked to me about how sometimes if there is more than one such element, it’s almost like they’re having a conversation. That the two vessels almost are speaking to each other and that we connect them, even if they’re not literally next to each other or anything.\n\nStephen: The mind and eye very strongly draw lines between them. It’s so interesting, and it’s not just my own experience, but people I work with, and when we place pieces in the garden, it creates this other level of structure. And in some cases, this has been a surprising discovery for me, a very relatively small piece, say a globe of 24 inches tall, maybe even a little shorter, if it relates to a larger vessel, it can hold its own in a large space, because it somehow rides the larger energy of the big piece. So a piece that would by itself feel lost, if it has a big brother [laughter], it can tag along.\n\nMargaret: So as we’re looking around our gardens, and I think this is a good time, I don’t know, rather than when it’s in full swing. I feel like right now it’s the bones that I’m looking out at, and I feel like before I get distracted by, oh, those colorful flowers over there that are coming in six weeks or whatever. I feel like it’s a good time to think about things like that. And so it’s not just looking for that one moment always. It could be more than one spot and thinking about the relationship between them. And I love, I guess because of the nature of the place where I live—and it’s not huge; it’s a couple of acres. But where the house is positioned, and the fact that there are woods around it at the perimeter, so it feels bigger than it is. And so I love that sort placing things at a distant view, creating almost axial endpoints like, “Ooh, look up there.”\n\nAnd I know that’s one of the more obvious things that such a sculpture could do, but I also love that. I love the sense of not just right here in the immediate distance, but let’s look out there, too.\n\nStephen: Yes. And often one placed in the near and one placed far, in a sense amplifies the sense of distance. It dramatizes the distance to the far view in a very interesting way.\n\nMargaret: Well, and it’s interesting that you say that, because when garden-designer friends have come and tried to teach me [laughter] about garden design over the years, one of the things they’ve told me when I was like, “Oh, well, I think I want to put a gold-leaf shrub way, way in the distance so that it screams to me from across the yard, out the window from across the yard.” And they’re like, “Yes, that’s a great idea. But along the way, maybe on the left and right of that sort of axis, not a literal path but a visual path, maybe you want to have one or a couple of other elements, spots of gold, to help you travel there.”\n\nSo that sort of duet again, or it might be a trio [laughter] of pots or plants. So some of the same design ideas, I guess, is what I’m saying, come into play with thinking about these sculptures as opposed just as they do with designing with plants.\n\nStephen: In a sense, they become visual guideposts that take the eye from one point to another, to another, to another, to a destination. In a certain way it reminds me of the way a skillful painter will choreograph how your eye moves over the painting. And I think you can use elements such as this or as you mentioned, a particular palette of plant you’re using, to accomplish a similar thing.\n\nMargaret: You just said choreograph, and you’re giving yourself away, because you had a career in music before you became a ceramic artist. Yes?\n\nStephen: Yes, I did. And I was not looking to get involved in clay. It was a sort of surprising midlife seduction. Not one I regret. And strangely, I found the transition from music to clay at the meta level, very seamless. It felt like working with many of the same elements and working with the same impulses. I sometimes say what I had been doing in sound and time, I was now doing with material and space. The common thread being looking to find the line that’s revelatory.\n\nMargaret: Hmmm. So you’re also teaching now. You’re teaching people to make these, to create these large vessels. Yes? That’s another that you’ve sort of branched out into that, and you’re teaching not only, I think, at your place, but elsewhere, including I think, in Europe this year for the first time maybe?\n\nStephen: I am. I have a lovely invitation from two studios in Amsterdam, and they’ve put together four days of teaching for me in early June, which I’m really looking forward to.\n\nI want to qualify slightly what you said there, Margaret. I’m teaching people that technique that I use to build pieces sectionally, and I’m hoping that people won’t be building my pots [laughter]. I have discovered over the years, against my better judgment, I sometimes allow my students to use tools that I have designed and developed specifically to achieve the curves that I’m after. And not surprisingly, I discover, “Oh my gosh, your pot is just like mine. Give me back those tools.” [Laughter.]\n\nMargaret: Right. But you’re teaching the method.\n\nStephen: I’m teaching the technique that I’ve developed. It’s a little bit distinctive. It’s drawing on bits and pieces from here and there, and putting them together in a way that suits my personality and my physique, and the way I like to do things. And it’s also very accessible for people. As someone who is in clay, self-taught, and I’ll say that with an asterisk because we all rely on millennia of experimentation by previous potters. But as someone who’s not formally trained in pottery and just figured out how to do this stuff, I feel like what I do and the way I do it is going to be accessible to an intermediate-level potter.\n\nMargaret: I didn’t ask you yet, but I have to ask you: your own home garden. Now, I know that it’s smallish, and I think you told me that your wife maybe had issued a proclamation [laughter] about some changes this spring, summer. She said there are going to be some redos of some areas, or is there so updates ahead?\n\nStephen: Instead of being a repository for my firing disasters [laughter], she’d like to get a first. We have the shoemaker’s children phenomenon going on here. So yeah, I’ll be bringing home a perfect pot to grace our little postage-stamp garden soon.\n\nMargaret: And is there any new planting going to go on, or what all … Is it ornamental stuff or vegetables or both or what?\n\nStephen: It’s ornamental. We have this tiny little lot that we share with our duplex neighbors, and it’s ornamental. My sister had a very brief flirtation with trying to start a garden-design business after she retired from a career as an educator. And she has a talent for it and put in a garden for us. And our main specifications were color all season long, and low maintenance. Because the studio consumes me 120 percent, and my wife is also involved in clay and runs her own community clay studio. So sadly, we don’t have a lot of time to spend in the garden ourselves. So those two requirements suit us well.\n\nMargaret: And now a third requirement, which is a pot that isn’t second-handed. No cracks please. No cracks. O.K. [Laughter.]\n\nWell, I’m so glad to talk to you again, and as I said, I hope that this will just, some of these thoughts from your experience, working with your type of vessels with clients and so forth, will be inspirational for people as they think about enhancements to their own garden this year, whatever material or vessels or whatever they plan to use. Because I think it’s an important part of the overall design hanging together. And I was so glad to meet you and talk to you. So thank you, Stephen.\n\nStephen: Thank you so much.

        "summary": "Pin 2 2 Shares\n\nIT’S THAT TIME of year when we gardeners are shopping, shopping, shopping, often in hot pursuit of just the right plant that will make the design of a bed or the larger landscape hang together—that elusive missing ingredient. Stephen, who is Vermont-based, has for about 20 years has created monumental stoneware vessels that live in the landscape all four seasons. Stephen Procter: Thank goodness for Instagram. Because many of my virtual colleagues or whatever, friends and garden designer friends and other keen gardener friends, follow you there. And since those conversations we had for that story, I keep looking around my garden with a different eye, I have to say, thanks to you. So I think of myself more as a sculptor who works in clay. But neither in scale nor purpose is that what they’re for. And I know that when we did the “Times” story, you were explaining to me that in the world of ceramics there is this sort of, we’ll say discussion, but it might be a little tenser than that at times [laughter], about functional ceramics, functional pottery versus I don’t know what the other end of it is, whether it’s art or not. Stephen: Versus nonfunctional or decorative. I think of them as functional on a quasi-spiritual level, if you will. Margaret: Well, but I think the garden is, I mean to me, what else are we doing out there? I mean, hopefully it elevates us and the space. But he talks about placing a jar on a hill and what that does to the surrounding landscape. It becomes a very interesting conversation, to my mind. But in other words, what I’m trying to say is that this could be a sculptural element, a non-plant element of another substance, but you’d have to consider its durability and its being weatherproof (or lack of being weatherproof).

        "text": "Keeping up with an industry as fast-moving as AI is a tall order. So until an AI can do it for you, here’s a handy roundup of recent stories in the world of machine learning, along with notable research and experiments we didn’t cover on their own.\n\nThis week, Meta released the latest in its Llama series of generative AI models: Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B. Capable of analyzing and writing text, the models are “open sourced,” Meta said — intended to be a “foundational piece” of systems that developers design with their unique goals in mind.\n\n“We believe these are the best open source models of their class, period,” Meta wrote in a blog post. “We are embracing the open source ethos of releasing early and often.”\n\nThere’s only one problem: the Llama 3 models aren’t really “open source,” at least not in the strictest definition.\n\nOpen source implies that developers can use the models how they choose, unfettered. But in the case of Llama 3 — as with Llama 2 — Meta has imposed certain licensing restrictions. For example, Llama models can’t be used to train other models. And app developers with over 700 million monthly users must request a special license from Meta.\n\nDebates over the definition of open source aren’t new. But as companies in the AI space play fast and loose with the term, it’s injecting fuel into long-running philosophical arguments.\n\nLast August, a study co-authored by researchers at Carnegie Mellon, the AI Now Institute and the Signal Foundation found that many AI models branded as “open source” come with big catches — not just Llama. The data required to train the models is kept secret. The compute power needed to run them is beyond the reach of many developers. And the labor to fine-tune them is prohibitively expensive.\n\nSo if these models aren’t truly open source, what are they, exactly? That’s a good question; defining open source with respect to AI isn’t an easy task.\n\nOne pertinent unresolved question is whether copyright, the foundational IP mechanism open source licensing is based on, can be applied to the various components and pieces of an AI project, in particular a model’s inner scaffolding (e.g. embeddings). Then, there’s the mismatch between the perception of open source and how AI actually functions to overcome: open source was devised in part to ensure that developers could study and modify code without restrictions. With AI, though, which ingredients you need to do the studying and modifying is open to interpretation.\n\nWading through all the uncertainty, the Carnegie Mellon study does make clear the harm inherent in tech giants like Meta co-opting the phrase “open source.”\n\nOften, “open source” AI projects like Llama end up kicking off news cycles — free marketing — and providing technical and strategic benefits to the projects’ maintainers. The open source community rarely sees these same benefits, and, when they do, they’re marginal compared to the maintainers’.\n\nInstead of democratizing AI, “open source” AI projects — especially those from big tech companies — tend to entrench and expand centralized power, say the study’s co-authors. That’s good to keep in mind the next time a major “open source” model release comes around.\n\nHere are some other AI stories of note from the past few days:\n\nMeta updates its chatbot: Coinciding with the Llama 3 debut, Meta upgraded its AI chatbot across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp — Meta AI — with a Llama 3-powered backend.

Swiss researchers found that not only can they, but if they are pre-armed with some personal information about you, they can actually be more persuasive in a debate than a human with that same info.\n\n“This is Cambridge Analytica on steroids,” said project lead Robert West from EPFL. The researchers suspect the model — GPT-4 in this case — drew from its vast stores of arguments and facts online to present a more compelling and confident case. But the outcome kind of speaks for itself. Don’t underestimate the power of LLMs in matters of persuasion, West warned: “In the context of the upcoming US elections, people are concerned because that’s where this kind of technology is always first battle tested. One thing we know for sure is that people will be using the power of large language models to try to swing the election.”\n\nWhy are these models so good at language anyway? That’s one area there is a long history of research into, going back to ELIZA. If you’re curious about one of the people who’s been there for a lot of it (and performed no small amount of it himself), check out this profile on Stanford’s Christopher Manning. He was just awarded the John von Neuman Medal; congrats!\n\nIn a provocatively titled interview, another long-term AI researcher (who has graced the TechCrunch stage as well), Stuart Russell, and postdoc Michael Cohen speculate on “How to keep AI from killing us all.” Probably a good thing to figure out sooner rather than later! It’s not a superficial discussion, though — these are smart people talking about how we can actually understand the motivations (if that’s the right word) of AI models and how regulations ought to be built around them.\n\nThe interview is actually regarding a paper in Science published earlier this month, in which they propose that advanced AIs capable of acting strategically to achieve their goals, which they call “long-term planning agents,” may be impossible to test. Essentially, if a model learns to “understand” the testing it must pass in order to succeed, it may very well learn ways to creatively negate or circumvent that testing. We’ve seen it at a small scale, why not a large one?\n\nRussell proposes restricting the hardware needed to make such agents… but of course, Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs just got their deliveries. LANL just had the ribbon-cutting ceremony for Venado, a new supercomputer intended for AI research, composed of 2,560 Grace Hopper Nvidia chips.\n\nAnd Sandia just received “an extraordinary brain-based computing system called Hala Point,” with 1.15 billion artificial neurons, built by Intel and believed to be the largest such system in the world. Neuromorphic computing, as it’s called, isn’t intended to replace systems like Venado, but to pursue new methods of computation that are more brain-like than the rather statistics-focused approach we see in modern models.\n\n“With this billion-neuron system, we will have an opportunity to innovate at scale both new AI algorithms that may be more efficient and smarter than existing algorithms, and new brain-like approaches to existing computer algorithms such as optimization and modeling,” said Sandia researcher Brad Aimone. Sounds dandy… just dandy!",

So you’re creating the game with GB Studio? Is this a completely solo effort or are you making it as part of a team?\n\nThe game is being created in GB Studio version 3.1.0, using tiles to create the map, sprites for NPCs, and animations. I partnered with my neighbour Rodrigo Nuñez – he’s a musician and is a part of a Celtic music band, so he knew a lot about the tunes used for that mood. I told him about the game and he created over 23 tracks. After that he recreated the original soundtrack with his band which you can hear on Spotify. I also teamed up with a good friend who I worked with on Pato Box, his name is Antonio Gutierrez and he’s dedicated to porting the game once I’m finished. Everything else, the sprites, the story, the programming I am doing myself.\n\nGB Studio is of course designed to be very user-friendly, have you found that you’re bumping up against its limitations at all or is it doing everything that you want it to do?\n\nIt obviously has some limitations. For example, having to optimise the game so it fits into 4mb is quite the challenge. People are always surprised at how small that is, smaller than pictures on a phone sometimes. The game will last around 24 hours, that part was really challenging. It is really easy because it’s drag-and-drop but as I didn’t have any experience as a programmer, I don’t know any language code so I needed to get familiarised with the process – the logic of creating the game.\n\nYou were kind enough to share a demo build with us and I was really struck by the progression system. It reminded me of The Frog for Whom the Bell Tolls – not that you progress in the same way, but in that it feels familiar to something like The Legend of Zelda but with a vastly different approach to navigating through the world.\n\nI played a bit of that while researching for the game. The controls play like the first Legend of Zelda because I couldn’t make something really complex with the limitations. The currency system you could compare to an EXP points system – I studied a lot about how Dragon Quest 1 worked and translated that into achievement points instead of experience by killing enemies. The visuals are based on games like Final Fantasy Adventure, and Link’s Awakening. Some of the assets are based on the Mother series and even Pokémon.\n\nHow did the idea for the achievement system come about?\n\nI’m a World of Warcraft player so for me the achievement system within video games started there, but the idea was really born from A Link to the Past on the SNES – a specific part in the game when you had to drop rupees over and over again to upgrade bombs and arrows and I remember always as a kid trying to do that first. It was grindy but I really enjoyed having that reward of repeating the same action over and over again. That was the origin of the idea for Glory Hunters – to have certain events or challenges that you could repeat over again and scale into experience or currency you could use to open the world freely. That’s evolved but it’s the origin of the idea.\n\nThe game is having a physical release through Bitmap Soft – how did that partnership come about?\n\nI joined the first GB competition on itch.io in 2021 and the demo was a finalist among 137 entries. After that I was contacted on Twitter by Bitmap Soft which was one of four or five publishers at the time creating new games for retro consoles. They said they were interested in the game, I told them I loved their games and that would be awesome - but I wanted to create a Kickstarter to reach more people. Together we figured out the campaign, I would create the game and they would make it physically for all the backers, and after that they would keep producing the game based on demand. The Kickstarter was in 2022 and we made about 130% of our target.\n\nHow is development going? Are you confident in reaching your 2024 target?\n\nOriginally development was meant to last one year but my second son was due to come into the world. Mixing children with all that happened with COVID, having COVID myself – a lot of issues has meant we are now two years into development.\n\nFinally, while we’ve been chatting I can’t help but admire that Game Boy behind you – it’s enormous!\n\nYeah, it’s about one metre tall. It actually works – we’ve been taking it to events with original Game Boys for people to try out the game. It’s a lot of work creating an indie game without any money, but it’s been awesome to see people playing it.\n\nWhat I’ve noticed is that many of the people who are interested in the game or the Kickstarter seem to be parents, people like me who grew up with a Game Boy, a simple system with a few buttons. They want a new experience with a familiar console and to share that with their kids. I’ve created the game with that in mind. You can get gratification in short bursts because parents don’t have a lot of time. You can complete the game within a few hours by getting to one corner of the map and defeating a god, but then if you want to go deeper down the rabbit hole it’ll take a lot more time. There’s an unlock and a ‘good’ ending. I’d love to know how many people see it.\n\nNext up is Matt Hughson, whose game-dev day job has him working at The Coalition. A prolific designer in the homebrew NES scene, Matt took on the challenge of porting one of his best-known titles, From Below, to the Game Boy using the ZGB and GBDK2020 libraries.\n\nNintendo Life: Hi Matt, tell us a bit about yourself and how you got into developing games.\n\nMatt Hughson: I’m in my 40s so I grew up with the NES, Game Boy, all that stuff – that’s kind of a cornerstone of my childhood, the heyday of Mario Mania. After childhood I got pretty into the NES in the late '90s when emulation kind of exploded, I ran some emulation websites and then went to Full Sail School in Florida for game design where I earned my degree. Despite its name it is not a sailing school, which seems to confuse everyone I talk to, they teach digital media which is super common now but when I went back in 2001 it was quite a novelty, there were no game programs at national universities, it was really only Digipen and Full Sail. From there I came back to Canada, first working in a school then transferring to Electronic Arts - bouncing around companies in Vancouver and I’m now at Microsoft working on the Gears of War franchise.\n\nYou mention your love for the NES – I believe you’ve made games for the NES before?\n\nYeah, as I mentioned I’ve been working for about 20 years professionally in the industry and then I started getting into NES development around 2020 just as a hobby thing. I released From Below for the NES in 2020, then my next game was Witch n’ Wiz, kind of a puzzle platformer also for the NES. Then I switched over to the Game Boy for From Below Pocket. Now I’m back on the NES for an action platformer called Super Sunny World which is a kind of love letter to NES Mario games.\n\nSubscribe to Nintendo Life on YouTube 764k\n\nYou ported From Below from the NES to the Game Boy – what made you decide to do this and what challenges did you face when porting it?\n\nI guess the root motivation was that I love the Game Boy. And I think maybe a technical reason I was interested in doing a port was because I write most of my games in C instead of Assembly – which most old games were written in. Now to rewrite them in C you pay the cost of performance. I wrote From Below for the NES 99% in C with some bits from some Assembly libraries and then there are also libraries for the Game Boy which allow you to compile C, so I could take the core engine and just compile the game on the Game Boy with little to no work for the core gameplay. So that interested me, the thought that I could take the exact same game and run it on Game Boy – though there’s obviously a lot more work to it than that.\n\nThe two biggest challenges were the resolution change and the multiplayer. It’s lower resolution than the NES, the Game Boy’s about 144 [pixels] high and 160 wide whereas the NES is 256 by 240 – so basically cut in half. In addition to that, for the Tetris-style gameplay the traditional board is 10 blocks wide and 20 blocks high; on the Game Boy render is 8x8 sprites, so if you do the math you can’t actually fit that in on the Game Boy screen.\n\nSo if you look at the Nintendo Tetris board for the Game Boy, it is only 10 wide and 18 high, which is not really the traditional gameplay - so I wanted to kind of fix that. I did a bunch of technical tricks to essentially squish the screen so instead of being 144 pixels high it’s about 180 pixels high and I do it by skipping rendering every 8th scanline – so instead of 8x8 sprites, it’s essentially 8x7 sprites. So if you look closely the blocks aren’t actually square they’re slightly squished. That was a bit of a technical challenge and it kind of messes with the logic a little but it means that From Below is, as far as I know, the only game on the Game Boy that has the full 10x20 game board.\n\nOn top of that I wanted to add multiplayer and that was by far the hardest part of the game – a peer-to-peer game where you’re sending one byte at a time, it’s really complicated. And I had it easy! I had libraries I was building on top of and a lot of the low-level stuff was done for me but there were still tons of bugs and loads of edge cases to deal with.\n\nThe Game Boy is well known for its block puzzle games – you’ve mentioned the full-size board which makes it unique amongst its predecessors but tell us a little more about it and what makes it different.\n\nSo the core hook is this Kraken monster at the bottom of the screen and he’s pushing his tentacles up from the bottom of the ocean onto the gameboard. As he does so he’s pushing a row of blocks up as well as leaving garbage blocks on the board while you’re clearing. If you clear a line over his tentacle he retreats – so this push and pull adds a twist to it. And on top of that, there’s the idea that sometimes he can help you – he can push blocks into empty spaces which normally you wouldn’t be able to reach, so you can use him to your advantage as well.\n\nOne of the core design philosophies I was aiming for was taking modern design sensibilities and adding them to this classic game, so if you play classic Tetris or Game Boy Tetris, there are a lot of modern things that you might forget or might not realise are missing – things like wall kicks, lock delay so you can slide the block when it lands, little things like that to make it feel really good and fluid. Recently someone played Tetris for hours and hours to ‘beat’ the game – you can play at the highest level and it never gets harder. To combat that scenario and keep the games relatively short, once you reach level 30 there’s basically a soft kill screen. So every level you beat the floor slowly rises so you have a smaller space to work with. By the time you reach level 40 you’re essentially forced to play in the top third of the level while everything below it is locked – it’s basically impossible because it’s lightning fast at that point too, but it’s intentional to make it so you get as many points as you can before that point and then you have a bit of a 'soft' chance to maybe score a few more lines. At that point, lines in Tetris are worth tons of points so it just ensures that nobody’s going to have to play this game for four hours to get the world record. The longest play is 20 minutes or so.\n\nAs I ended up nearing completion, a bunch of the hardcore NES Tetris players found it and they started giving me feedback so a lot of what I’ve talked about is from them. I had no idea that stuff existed, I just kept feeding off them and pushing more and more into the game until it felt really good. I’m so thankful they found it because there was lots of stuff that was totally broken that would’ve just ruined the game for high-level Tetris players.\n\nDo you have a world record scoreboard currently?\n\nI think it’s two million. It’s on my Discord – I keep it there. I think someone hit that last year, which is just insane to me.\n\nYou had a limited run on cartridges – did you do that yourself or were they produced for you?\n\nIt was a bit of a mix. For the original NES game I did a super limited run of 100 copies and the first 50 I basically did myself. I contacted a guy on Etsy who made boxes and they turned out to be in Vancouver. I bought the PCBs from Broke Studio in France and I ordered the shells from China. It was an amalgamation for that first 50 which was a ton of work and really stressful, and if one doesn’t work you’re kind of screwed.\n\nSo for the second run I just went through Broke Studio because they also do the complete-in-box service, the shipping and everything. I did eBay for those batches; for the Game Boy version and a rerelease of the NES version I set up my own store, took all the orders, and passed that on to Broke Studio who did the manufacturing and distribution for me. Witch n’ Wiz before went through Limited Run Games.\n\nSubscribe to Nintendo Life on YouTube 764k\n\nSuper Sunny World for the NES is your current project – what’s the release date for that and do you have any plans for the Game Boy after that?\n\nI’m hoping to release this summer. When I started it was meant to be a one-month project – that was a year ago. I wanted to do something quick, a little homage to Mario 1, but it went so well that I decided to keep working on it. It’s really close to done – I have all the levels done, all the core gameplay is done, I’m just working on bosses which is taking a long time and I want to do some meta-game stuff. Finding hidden collectibles, maybe a slot machine to buy in-game items like Smash Bros. – something like that.\n\nThen I’d love to return to Game Boy. I’d love to do a Witch n’ Wiz port. It's kind of like a spiritual successor to Catrap – it takes the core concept of Catrap for the first ten levels but then every ten levels after I switch the mechanics. You can loop around the edge of the screen for the next ten levels like Asteroids, later on you can flip gravity. Catrap was such an awesome game I feel like Witch n’ Wiz would be too. I was also thinking of doing a Super Sunny port like a Super Sunny Land similar to Super Mario Land – not a straight port but a reimagining on a smaller screen. I just need to get this done first!\n\nFinally, 7FH has seen five physical Game Boy releases in a variety of different genres and is a dab hand at squeezing magic out of the tiny portable using the GBDK2020 library.\n\nNintendo Life: Hi 7FH, tell us a bit about yourself and how you got into developing.\n\n7FH: I'm 42 and come from Germany. Around 2019, I discovered the GBDK (Game Boy Development Kit), which allows you to develop your own Game Boy games using C. I was fascinated by the idea of creating my own game, so I looked around for tutorials and code examples.\n\nYou’re a prolific Game Boy creator with five physical releases to date. Tell us a little about each game.\n\nAll my games are developed using the GBDK. It delivers only a few basic functions but no complete game engine. Developing the game engine is one of the most fun parts.\n\nGenesis (2020) is a vertical scrolling shoot ‘em up mostly inspired by Solar Striker.\n\nBlack Castle (2020) is an action platformer. It’s said to be a mixture of Super Mario Land and Castlevania.\n\nGunship (2021) is a vertical-scrolling rail shooter. This type of game hardly exists on the Game Boy, which prompted me to develop such a game.\n\nG-Zero (2022) is a F-Zero-like racing game. I found one day an F-Zero pixel art demake on the internet which inspired me.\n\nGenesis 2 (2024) is the successor to Genesis. Genesis got some bad reviews... it was my first game and I didn’t know the hardware that well yet. So I wanted to prove that I can do it better.\n\nDo any of the other games draw inspiration from other Game Boy titles you’ve enjoyed?\n\nGenesis 1 and 2 also take inspiration from Nemesis 1 and 2. You can tell that from the name alone. Black Castle picks up on some elements of the Ghost 'n Goblins game series.",

Earnings from Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META) and many more are on deck. Tesla, which reports Tuesday, slashed EV and FSD prices over the weekend.\n\nX\n\nThe stock market suffered sharp losses in the past week. The Dow Jones actually rose a fraction. But the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite plunged below their respective 50-day moving averages, suffering their worst week in more than a year.\n\nMost of all, leading stocks were the biggest losers. Nvidia (NVDA), the ultimate AI stock and company, dived below key support.\n\nChip and AI stocks sold off on cautious comments from ASML (ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM).\n\nAI server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) crashed Friday after not releasing preliminary results, raising fears about AI demand overall.\n\nThe market environment is decidedly weak. Investors should be largely in cash, waiting for renewed signs of strength in the major indexes and leading stocks.\n\nKey Earnings Ahead\n\nMicrosoft, Meta Platforms, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) headline a huge week of earnings. General Electric (GE), ServiceNow (NOW), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Dexcom (DXCM) and Caterpillar (CAT) are among the many other notable reports on tap.\n\nGoogle stock is in a buy zone. Meta stock, Chipotle and Caterpillar could be setting up, while Dexcom has retreated slightly below a buy point. GE is greatly extended while Microsoft and ServiceNow are starting to crack. Tesla stock has plunged to 52-week lows amid a host of bad news.\n\nThese reports and guidance will have a huge impact on their sectors and overall market. Microsoft, Google, Meta and ServiceNow will offer insights into artificial intelligence, as well as cloud computing, online advertising and business software.\n\nFor Tesla, there are huge questions regarding the EV giant's growth strategy. Most of all, is Elon Musk shelving a next-generation Model 2?\n\nOn Saturday, Tesla cut Model Y, S and X prices in the U.S. by $2,000, while also cutting Full Self-Driving to $8,000 from $12,000.\n\nOn Sunday, Tesla cut China prices for the Model 3 and Y by nearly $2,000 while slashing Model S and X prices by up to 22%. Tesla also cut Model 3 prices in key European markets by roughly $2,100-$3,200.\n\nMeta stock is on IBD Leaderboard. Microsoft stock is on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list. Meta, DexCom and Google stock are on the IBD 50.

The S&P 500 index tumbled 3.05%, its biggest weekly decline since March 2023. The Nasdaq composite plunged 5.5%, its worst week since November 2022. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 2.8%.\n\nThe market's power trend, in force since November, is over as the Nasdaq's 21-day exponential moving average undercut the 50-day line.\n\nSome stocks are holding support, with a few making encouraging moves. But generally leading stocks are looking damaged or broken.\n\nAI and chip stocks had been holding up reasonably well. But they led the downside this past week, with Nvidia and especially Super Micro plunging on Friday.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility index, or VIX, briefly spiked Friday to the market fear gauge's highest levels since late October. Meanwhile, various indicators suggest the market is significantly oversold. But it's been oversold for some time.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield jumped 11 basis points to 4.61%, hitting a five-month intraday high of nearly 4.7% on Tuesday. Markets now expect just one Fed rate cut in 2024.\n\nU.S. crude oil futures fell 2.9% to $83.14 a barrel for the week.\n\nTesla Plunges With One Big Question For The Earnings Call\n\nETFs\n\nAmong growth ETFs, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) plunged 5.1%. Microsoft is a huge IGV holding, with ServiceNow stock a key component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) dived 9.7%. Nvidia stock is the No. 1 holding in SMH, with Taiwan Semi and ASML key members.\n\nSPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) dipped 0.8% last week. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) retreated 2.8%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) jumped 4.7%. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) skidded 3.9%.\n\nThe Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) fell 1.25% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) closed fractionally higher. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) gave up 2%, with Caterpillar and GE stock the top two holdings.\n\nThe Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) advanced 0.85% and the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) climbed 1.8%.\n\nReflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) sold off 9.6% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 10%. Tesla stock is a huge holding across Ark Invest's ETFs.\n\nTime The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nAI Hardware Stocks Plunge\n\nAI chip and hardware stocks, the driving force of the market rally from late October to early March, were the big losers last week.\n\nASML plunged 10.6% for the week on weak Q1 sales and guidance. That also dragged down other chip-equipment makers.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor stock dived 10.4% despite beating views and guiding higher, fueled by AI chip demand. But the foundry giant was cautious about demand for chips overall.\n\nNvidia tumbled 13.6%, including Friday's 10% dive to knife through the 50-day. It's now given up over two-thirds of its gains following the fiscal Q1 earnings on Feb. 21.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) crashed 31% for the week\n\nSMCI stock dived 20.6% for the week even with Tuesday's 10.6% spike. Shares dived 23.1% on Friday, literally on no news. Disappointing investors, Super Micro didn't give preliminary results as the AI server maker announced its upcoming Q1 earnings date. That might have also raised concerns about AI chip demand.\n\nAll of these stocks flashed sell signals.\n\nSMCI and Nvidia are the two biggest winners on the S&P 500 in 2024, but they were the S&P 500's biggest losers Friday.\n\nCatch The Next Big Winning Stock With MarketSurge\n\nWhat To Do Now\n\nThe stock market is in bad shape. The major indexes are all well below their 50-day moving averages. Nvidia and other tech standouts are no longer resisting the selling but instead starting to lead the slide.\n\nIt's not a time to be buying stocks. Investors should have slim-to-modest exposure, generally only keeping winners with a hefty cushion.\n\nThis is a time to build watchlists. You want to look for stocks finding support and showing relative strength.\n\nThere are some names holding up, including GE, Google, Meta, Chipotle, Glaukos (GKOS), Martin Marietta (MLM) and Allstate (ALL).\n\nRemember that in a downtrend, resilient stocks today may not stay that way tomorrow, as Nvidia, Super Micro and ServiceNow showed.\n\nAnd relative winners can be absolute losers.\n\nEarnings season could provide a positive catalyst for stocks.

        "text": "WASHINGTON — Don Beyer’s car dealerships were among the first in the U.S. to set up a website. As a representative, the Virginia Democrat leads a bipartisan group focused on promoting fusion energy. He reads books about geometry for fun.\n\nSo when questions about regulating artificial intelligence emerged, the 73-year-old Beyer took what for him seemed like an obvious step, enrolling at George Mason University to get a master’s degree in machine learning. In an era when lawmakers and Supreme Court justices sometimes concede they don’t understand emerging technology, Beyer’s journey is an outlier, but it highlights a broader effort by members of Congress to educate themselves about artificial intelligence as they consider laws that would shape its development.\n\nFrightening to some, thrilling to others, baffling to many: Artificial intelligence has been called a transformative technology, a threat to democracy or even an existential risk for humanity. It will fall to members of Congress to figure out how to regulate the industry in a way that encourages its potential benefits while mitigating the worst risks.\n\nBut first they have to understand what AI is, and what it isn’t.\n\n“I tend to be an AI optimist,” Beyer told The Associated Press following a recent afternoon class on George Mason’s campus in suburban Virginia. “We can’t even imagine how different our lives will be in five years, 10 years, 20 years, because of AI. … There won’t be robots with red eyes coming after us any time soon. But there are other deeper existential risks that we need to pay attention to.”\n\nRisks like massive job losses in industries made obsolete by AI, programs that retrieve biased or inaccurate results, or deepfake images, video and audio that could be leveraged for political disinformation, scams or sexual exploitation. On the other side of the equation, onerous regulations could stymie innovation, leaving the U.S. at a disadvantage as other nations look to harness the power of AI.\n\nStriking the right balance will require input not only from tech companies but also from the industry’s critics, as well as from the industries that AI may transform. While many Americans may have formed their ideas about AI from science fiction movies like “The Terminator” or “The Matrix,” it’s important that lawmakers have a clear-eyed understanding of the technology, said Rep. Jay Obernolte, R-Calif., and the chairman of the House’s AI Task Force.\n\nWhen lawmakers have questions about AI, Obernolte is one of the people they seek out. He studied engineering and applied science at the California Institute of Technology and earned an M.S. in artificial intelligence at UCLA. The California Republican also started his own video game company. Obernolte said he’s been “very pleasantly impressed” with how seriously his colleagues on both sides of the aisle are taking their responsibility to understand AI.\n\nThat shouldn’t be surprising, Obernolte said. After all, lawmakers regularly vote on bills that touch on complicated legal, financial, health and scientific subjects. If you think computers are complicated, check out the rules governing Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nKeeping up with the pace of technology has challenged Congress since the steam engine and the cotton gin transformed the nation’s industrial and agricultural sectors. Nuclear power and weaponry is another example of a highly technical subject that lawmakers have had to contend with in recent decades, according to Kenneth Lowande, a University of Michigan political scientist who has studied expertise and how it relates to policy-making in Congress.\n\nFederal lawmakers have created several offices — the Library of Congress, the Congressional Budget Office, etc. — to provide resources and specialized input when necessary. They also rely on staff with specific expertise on subject topics, including technology.\n\nThen there’s another, more informal form of education that many members of Congress receive.\n\n“They have interest groups and lobbyists banging down their door to give them briefings,” Lowande said.\n\nBeyer said he’s had a lifelong interest in computers and that when AI emerged as a topic of public interest he wanted to know more. A lot more. Almost all of his fellow students are decades younger; most don’t seem that fazed when they discover their classmate is a congressman, Beyer said.\n\nHe said the classes, which he fits in around his busy congressional schedule — are already paying off. He’s learned about the development of AI and the challenges facing the field. He said it’s helped him understand the challenges — biases, unreliable data — and the possibilities, like improved cancer diagnoses and more efficient supply chains.\n\nBeyer is also learning how to write computer code.\n\n“I’m finding that learning to code — which is thinking in this sort of mathematical, algorithmic step-by-step, is helping me think differently about a lot of other things — how you put together an office, how you work a piece of legislation,” Beyer said.\n\nWhile a computer science degree isn’t required, it’s imperative that lawmakers understand AI’s implications for the economy, national defense, health care, education, personal privacy and intellectual property rights, according to Chris Pierson, CEO of the cybersecurity firm BlackCloak.\n\n“AI is not good or bad,” said Pierson, who formerly worked in Washington for the Department of Homeland Security. “It’s how you use it.”\n\nThe work of safeguarding AI has already begun, though it’s the executive branch leading the way so far. Last month, the White House unveiled new rules that require federal agencies to show their use of AI isn’t harming the public. Under an executive order issued last year, AI developers must provide information on the safety of their products.\n\nWhen it comes to more substantive action, America is playing catchup to the European Union, which recently enacted the world’s first significant rules governing the development and use of AI. The rules prohibit some uses — routine AI-enabled facial recognition by law enforcement, for one — while requiring other programs to submit information about safety and public risks. The landmark law is expected to serve as a blueprint for other nations as they contemplate their own AI laws.\n\nAs Congress begins that process, the focus must be on “mitigating potential harm,” said Obernolte, who said he’s optimistic that lawmakers from both parties can find common ground on ways to prevent the worst AI risks.\n\n“Nothing substantive is going to get done that isn’t bipartisan,” he said.\n\nTo help guide the conversation lawmakers created a new AI task force (Obernolte is co-chairman), as well as an AI Caucus made up of lawmakers with a particular expertise or interest in the topic. They’ve invited experts to brief lawmakers on the technology and its impacts — and not just computer scientists and tech gurus either, but also representatives from different sectors that see their own risks and rewards in AI.\n\nRep. Anna Eshoo is the Democratic chairwoman of the caucus. She represents part of California’s Silicon Valley and recently introduced legislation that would require tech companies and social media platforms like Meta, Google or TikTok to identify and label AI-generated deepfakes to ensure the public isn’t misled. She said the caucus has already proved its worth as a “safe place” place where lawmakers can ask questions, share resources and begin to craft consensus.\n\n“There isn’t a bad or silly question,” she said. “You have to understand something before you can accept or reject it.”\n\nGet more business news by signing up for our Economy Now newsletter.",

        "text": "India’s election overshadowed by the rise of online misinformation Greater internet penetration and the rise of \"cheapfakes\" since the last general election in 2019 pose new challenges\n\nAs India kicks off the world’s biggest election, which starts on April 19 and runs through June 1, the electoral landscape is overshadowed by misinformation.\n\nThe country — which has more than 830 million internet users and is home to the largest user base for social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram — is already at the highest risk of misinformation and disinformation, according to the World Economic Forum. AI has complicated the situation further, including deepfakes created with generative AI.\n\nMisinformation is not just a problem for election fairness — it can have deadly effects, including violence on the ground and increase hatred for minorities.\n\nPratik Sinha, the co-founder of the Indian non-profit fact-checking website Alt News, says there’s been an increase in the deliberate creation of misinformation to polarize society. “Ever since social media has been thriving, there is a new trend where you use misinformation to target communities,” he said.\n\nThe country’s vast diversity in language and culture also make it particularly hard for fact-checkers to review and filter out misleading content.\n\n“India is unusual in its size and its history of democracy,” Angie Drobnic Holan, the director of International Fact-Checking Network, told TechCrunch in an interview. “When you have got a lot of misinformation, you have a lot of need for fact-checking, and things that make the Indian environment more complex also are the many languages of India.”\n\nThe government has taken steps to address the problem, but some critics argue that enforcement is weak, and the Big Tech platforms aren’t helping enough.\n\nIn 2022, the Indian government updated its IT intermediary rules to require social media companies to remove misleading content from their platforms within 72 hours of being reported. However, the results are unclear, and some digital advocacy groups, including the Internet Freedom Foundation, have noticed selective enforcement.\n\n“You don’t want to have laws or rules that are so vague, that are so broad that they can be interpreted,” said Prateek Waghre, executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation.\n\nGoogle and Meta have made announcements about limiting misleading content on their platforms during Indian elections, and restricted their AI bots from answering election queries, but have announced no significant product-related changes or stringent actions against fake news. Moreover, just before the Indian election, Meta reportedly cut funding to news organizations for fact-checking on WhatsApp.\n\nNow fake news is proliferating on social media. Doctored videos of celebrities asking citizens to vote for a particular political party and fake news about the Model Code of Conduct applied to public programs and private chats were well spread online before the election began.\n\nHamsini Hariharan, a subject matter expert at the U.K.-based fact-checking startup Logically, told TechCrunch about the trend of “cheapfakes” — content generated with less sophisticated measures of altering images, videos, and audio — being widely shared across social media platforms in India.\n\nLast week, 11 civil society organizations in India, including the nonprofit digital rights groups Internet Freedom Foundation and Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC.in), urged the Indian election commission to hold political candidates and social media platforms accountable for any misuse.\n\nHariharan underlined that the scale and sophistication of misinformation and disinformation have drastically increased over the last five years since India’s last general election in 2019. The key reasons, she believes, are the increase in internet penetration — it’s grown from 14% in 2014 to around 50% now, according to World Bank data — and the availability of technologies to manipulate audiovisual messages, low media literacy, and the mainstream media losing some of its credibility.\n\nLogically noticed a particular spike in attempts to cast doubt about electronic voting machines. Its fact-checkers saw older claims, particularly videos and text from Supreme Court hearings about voting machines, being circulated without sufficient context. There were even some posts about these machines being banned, faulty or tempered with, along with hashtags such as #BanEVM circulated among Facebook groups with thousands of followers.\n\nSinha of Alt News agreed that misleading online content has rapidly risen in the country. He noted that social media companies are not helping to limit such content on their platforms.\n\n“Is there a single report that’s been published in four years as to how their fact-checking enterprise is doing? No, nothing, because they know it is not working. If it was working, they would have gone to town with it, but they know it’s not working,” he told TechCrunch.\n\nHolan believes there is much room for product changes that emphasize accuracy and reliability.\n\n“The platforms invested heavily during COVID in trust and safety programs. And since then, there’s clearly been a pullback,” she said.\n\nMeta and X did not answer why there have been no significant product-related updates to restrict misleading content and the amount of investments made for fact-checking in India. However, a Meta spokesperson noted the existence of a WhatsApp tip line, which was launched in late March, and an awareness campaign on Instagram to identify and stop misinformation using the platform’s built-in features.\n\n“We have a multi-pronged approach to tackling misinformation that includes building an industry-leading network of fact-checkers in the country, including training them on tackling AI-generated misinformation,” the Meta spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\nX did not answer a detailed questionnaire sent to the generic press email ID but said, “Busy now, please check back later.”",

The major indexes have broken decisively below 50-day moving averages. More leading stocks need significant work before triggering buy signals.\n\nInvestors should be looking for strong evidence of market strength before adding exposure. However, with that being said, these five stocks, which all are showing good relative strength, should be on investors watchlists.\n\nHubSpot Stock\n\nHUBS shares fell 2.8% to 631.24 on Friday, sinking 4.8% for the week. The marketing software firm had flirted with reclaiming a 660 buy point from a flat base, but was turned back. Shares are holding the 50-day moving average.\n\nHUBS stock broke out on April 4 on a report that Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) was mulling a bid for the marketing software maker. There was some buzz about another possible suitor on April 19.\n\nHubSpot develops customer relationship management software that combines marketing, sales, customer service, content, operations and commerce in a single platform. Its system of five modules, called hubs, can be used alone or bundled together. It uses AI in its website generator, content and email writer, meta description generator and social media blog writer.\n\nHubSpot is expected to report its fiscal first-quarter earnings around May 1. The AI stock is on the IBD 50 and the IBD Big Cap 20.\n\nHubSpot stock has a 98 Composite Rating out of 99. The AI stock has a 91 Relative Strength Rating. The EPS Rating for the AI play is a perfect 99.\n\nS&P 500: Allstate Stock\n\nAllstate stock advanced 2.3% on Friday, continuing to advance above an buy point. For the week, the S&P 500 stock gained 3.7% to 172.96.\n\nAllstate shares bounced from their 50-day moving average Thursday, reclaiming a 168.05 buy point from a cup base. The move Thursday broke a short downtrend. Meanwhile, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500, is at a 52-week high.\n\nAllstate was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day.\n\nThe insurance giant on Thursday estimated catastrophe losses for the month of March of $328 million, or $259 million after-tax. Total catastrophe losses for the first quarter were $731 million, pretax. Meanwhile, rate increases for Allstate brand auto insurance resulted in a premium impact of 0.9% in March and 2.4% year-to-date.\n\nAllstate also reported that rate increases for its brand homeowners insurance resulted in a premium impact of 0.7% in March and 3.4% so far this year.\n\nLast week, JPMorgan and Piper Sandler increased price targets on the S&P 500 stock to 185 and 188, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, HSBC last week upgraded Allstate to buy, from a previous hold rating, with a price target of 190, up from 158. HSBC wrote that rate increases continue to compound across personal auto and homeowners insurance in the U.S. and that decelerating inflationary trends put U.S. personal lines insurers \"in a sweet spot.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 stock has a 97 Composite Rating out of 99. Allstate also has a 91 Relative Strength Rating and an 81 EPS Rating.\n\nSea Limited Stock\n\nShares of Sea Limited fell 2.2% to 55.06 Friday but still climbed 3.3% to 55.06 on the week. The stock is bouncing off its 50-day moving average in an emerging base.\n\nInvestors could use the stock's April 10 high of 58.47 as an early entry. However, the consolidation probably needs another week or so with a buy point of 63.25, the stock's six-month high which it hit on March 14.\n\nSingapore-based e-commerce and gaming firm Sea Limited jumped Tuesday, rebounding from a recent dip to move ahead of its 21-day moving average.\n\nShares have gained nearly 40% this year after a rough 2023.\n\nA recent JPMorgan note looked at how efforts by TikTok Shop to improve take rates in Indonesia could allow Sea to do the same in the country for its Shopee e-commerce business.\n\nJPMorgan maintains an overweight rating for SE stock and a 70 price target. TikTok is a top competitor to Shopee in Indonesia.\n\nSea Limited is one of the largest internet services providers in Southeast Asia. It operates businesses in digital entertainment, e-commerce, and digital payments and financial services. The company's products include the e-commerce focused Shopee, which services Southeast Asia and Taiwan.\n\nThe company also owns digital-payments provider SeaMoney and Garena, a global online games developer.\n\nA strong earnings report in March helped push Sea stock higher.\n\nSea earnings are expected to soar in 2024.\n\nSea Limited stock has a 69 Composite Rating out of 99. The stock also has an 87 Relative Strength Rating. SE shares have a 19 EPS Rating.\n\nS&P 500: TransDigm Stock\n\nTransDigm stock fell 2.7% to 1,187.70 on the week, almost all on Friday. The S&P 500 stock has traded tightly for weeks, offering a 1,248.39 buy point. Shares are now just below the 50-day and 10-week moving average.\n\nCleveland-based TransDigm manufactures highly engineered parts and devices used in commercial and military aircraft, as well as proprietary products for defense applications. Its products include ignition systems, pumps, flight controls, cockpit displays and radio systems.\n\nIn February, TransDigm reported a 56% increase in adjusted earnings to $7.16 per share in Q1 compared to FactSet expectations of $6.41 per share. Revenue jumped 28% to $1.79 billion in Q1 while Wall Street anticipated $1.68 billion.\n\nRevenue from the commercial original equipment manufacturer (OEM) segment jumped 25% during the quarter. Commercial aftermarket sales leapt 22%. Defense revenue increased 28% for the quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 stock lifted its 2024 net sales outlook, predicting a range from $7.58 billion to $7.76 billion. That would represent a 16.4% increase at the midpoint compared to 2023.\n\nTransDigm guided 2024 adjusted EPS to $29.97-$31.73 per share, up from $25.84 per share in 2023. However, the S&P 500 play lowered its guidance by about $1.12 per share at the midpoint. That reflects about $130 million in additional interest expenses after issuing $2 billion of debt.\n\nIn 2023, TransDigm profit jumped 50% to $25.84 per share. Full fiscal-year revenue advanced 21% to $6.58 billion.\n\nTransDigm stock has a 90 Composite Rating out of 99. The S&P 500 stock also has a 92 Relative Strength Rating and a 91 EPS Rating.\n\nCava Stock\n\nCava fell 6.4% to 59.67 for the week, pulling below its 50-day and 10-week moving averages. A decisive retaking of those levels would offer an early entry. But a decisive break lower could be a sell signal.\n\nCava stock is out of range from its February breakout at 56.34, according to MarketSurge analysis. It's also far extended from two earlier breakouts, including one from an IPO base.\n\nThe Mediterranean restaurant chain specializes in falafel bowls and pita. Cava delivered its first profit on an annual basis on 60% revenue growth in 2023, the year it went public.\n\nCava ties its rapid growth to more new and repeat customers. On top of that, Cava benefits from the broader health and wellness trend. More generally, restaurant stocks continue to act well as inflationary pressures abate.\n\nFounded in 2010, Cava remains in the early stages of expansion after its initial public offering in June. Some people call Cava the next Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which sits on the S&P 500, due to its customizable bowls and growth potential.\n\nChipotle reports first-quarter earnings and revenue late Wednesday.\n\nCava was featured in IBD's New America on March 28. CAVA stock has a perfect 99 Composite Rating. The stock also has a 94 Relative Strength Rating and an 81 EPS Rating.\n\nPlease follow Kit Norton on X, formerly known as Twitter, @KitNorton for more coverage.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nIs Tesla Stock A Buy Or A Sell?\n\nGet Full Access To IBD Stock Lists And Ratings\n\nLearning How To Pick Great Stocks?

        "text": "Artificial intelligence has shaken up the investing landscape since the groundbreaking launch of ChatGPT in November 2022.\n\nSince then, investors have poured money into all things related to AI as they hunt for the next big winners. In 2023, a group of major technology players dubbed the Magnificent Seven — Tesla , Amazon , Meta Platforms , Apple , Microsoft , Alphabet and Nvidia — contributed to a large chunk of the market's rally.\n\nThose tail winds continued into 2024, but even the winners eventually reach their limit. Indeed, some of this year's highest fliers came down to earth on Friday, with Big Tech names dragging down the Nasdaq Composite by more than 2%.\n\n\"You have to do your work,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \"You want to do the research, you want to know what you're buying, you want to know the risks involved. In AI right now, there are a lot of unknowns.\"\n\nAI is poised to be a central theme as the technology transitions from early-stage winners to second-stage adopters. Portfolio and wealth managers say investors may want to undertake certain strategies if they're looking for long-term plays in the space.\n\nWhat to look for\n\nThere's no secret formula to investing and picking artificial intelligence stocks, but investors can keep an eye on certain metrics and trends when weeding out the winners from the duds.\n\nWhen investing in any new industry, Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, recommends that investors keep an eye on companies' cash burn and how they are spending their money. Be attentive to the fine details, including how a company works through a backlog and how much money it devotes toward infrastructure.\n\nWhen it comes to chip stocks, Schleif also recommends taking a look at government grants. The industry won big in 2022 when President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS Act into law. The measure allocated funds toward building out semiconductor production on U.S. soil.\n\nSamsung Electronics is in line to receive funding from CHIPS for making semiconductors in Texas, while Intel has been awarded up to $8.5 billion from the measure.\n\n\"Focus on the underlying fundamentals, and are they moving in the right direction, [rather] than just last quarter's earnings,\" Schleif advised.\n\nInvestors should also avoid blindly chasing the hot winners that have benefited from AI enthusiasm. For Laffer Tengler Investments CEO and CIO Nancy Tengler, that means looking at some of the old-economy stocks embracing the new digital wave. She likes Microsoft and IBM , a pair of tech industry veterans.\n\nWhen building any portfolio, financial advisors and portfolio managers stress the importance of diversification — and the same applies to AI.\n\nAn exchange-traded fund might be a good way to get that diversified exposure to a basket of stocks that could benefit from the AI theme, rather than sticking with one or two promising names.\n\nConsider diversifying through ETFs\n\nSelecting ETFs that incorporate dozens of names can be a lower-risk way to diversify, said Marguerita Cheng, a certified financial planner and CEO of Blue Ocean Global Wealth in Gaithersburg, Maryland.\n\nShe highlighted the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) , the First Trust Nasdaq AI and Robotics ETF (ROBT) and the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ).\n\n\"That's one way to get some exposure without putting the proverbial all the eggs in that one basket,\" said BMO's Schleif. \"You want to be able to focus on a few different avenues such that you can withstand the volatility.\"",
        "summary": "Artificial intelligence has shaken up the investing landscape since the groundbreaking launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. Since then, investors have poured money into all things related to AI as they hunt for the next big winners. Those tail winds continued into 2024, but even the winners eventually reach their limit. Indeed, some of this year's highest fliers came down to earth on Friday, with Big Tech names dragging down the Nasdaq Composite by more than 2%. What to look for\n\nThere's no secret formula to investing and picking artificial intelligence stocks, but investors can keep an eye on certain metrics and trends when weeding out the winners from the duds. When it comes to chip stocks, Schleif also recommends taking a look at government grants."

        "text": "Given everyone’s sustained interest in playing games on their phones, companies are eager to offer an experience that works better than just jabbing your fingers on a touchscreen. Razer, the maker of unapologetically robust and garish gaming devices, has a new offering that does just that.\n\nThe new Razer Kishi Ultra is a souped up controller that adds pro-level thumbsticks, buttons, and triggers to just about any mobile device. It’s the latest in Razer’s Kishi lineup of portable gaming devices, which launched in 2020. The two handles pull apart, allowing you to slide your phone in between them. Let the spring-loaded clamp grip your phone, and you’ve got something like a DIY Nintendo Switch. It uses a USB-C port to connect to the phone. In addition, it can handle an iPad Mini and any Android tablet measuring up to 8 diagonal inches as long as it has a USB-C port. The Kishi Ultra only works with USB-C iPhones, so it’s limited to iPhone 15 and beyond. (It can even handle some folding phones.) The Kishi Ultra can also connect to your PC via USB-C cable. Like nearly everything Razer makes, the Kishi Ultra is loaded up with RGB lighting options which you can change via the associated app, so you can have your fill of customizable flashiness.\n\nThe Kishi is unlike the Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, which are fully fledged portable gaming machines on their own. But gaming devices with more specific use cases are gaining popularity, like Playstation’s Portal device, which only lets you stream games from your existing PS5. Razer has been making gaming handheld devices since 2013, and has its own Steam Deck-style Razer Edge handheld. But more and more companies are eager to make devices that work with the screen you already have in your pocket. Devices like Razer’s latest and those from the gaming company Backbone are meant to strap controllers to the side of your device and enhance your mobile play time.\n\nHere’s some other consumer tech news from this week.\n\nMeta Adds an AI Images to WhatsApp\n\nMeta has added AI Image generation capabilities to its WhatsApp messaging platform. As part of its rollout for its Llama 3 large language model that came this week, the company has juiced up its Meta AI in-app offerings.\n\nThe AI image generation option in WhatsApp works like sending a text message. You can go into a private chat with Meta AI and type out a prompt. The keyword in the input field is “imagine,” so if you type that and a description of the image you want to create, the AI assistant will generate a visual representation of your prompt. And it happens nearly instantly. The image pops up on screen as you’re typing, and you can see the image change and generate in real time as you add more words to your prompt. This can get … quite weird as you add more parameters to your request, but the more descriptive you are, the more detail the generator can work into a picture. The resulting images are about what you would expect from any AI art source these days—weird proportions, humans with too many fingers, misplaced eyeballs. Still, it’s both neat and very strange to watch an AI generate your description of something as you’re writing it.\n\nMeet GMC’s Hulking New Denali EV Pickup\n\nPhotograph: GMC\n\nThere is a deluge of new EVs coming out this year, ranging from tiny three-wheeled smart cars like the Nimbus One to revved-up supercars like the upcoming electric Dodge Charger. Pickup trucks are a slightly more niche space in the EV market, aside from popular models like the Ford F-150 Lightning, Rivian’s offerings, and Tesla’s floundering Cybertruck (every one of which was just recalled.)",

Here's how\n\n“I mean, I’m rich enough, but I would have more money had I concentrated on those names,” Schiff added — referring to the seven giants dominating the U.S. stock market: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA) and Meta (META).\n\nHere’s why U.S. stock investors saw their wealth explode in the last decade — and why Schiff still cautions against being overweight equities.\n\nTop 1% rake in huge gains\n\nThe total net worth of the wealthiest 1% in the U.S. hit $44.6 trillion at the end of 2023, according to Federal Reserve data — a new record driven primarily by an end-of-year stock rally that boosted rich individuals’ investment portfolios.\n\nThat new wealth record marks an almost 50% jump from the first quarter of 2020, when the total net worth of the top 1% was $30.1 trillion.\n\nRead more: 'Baby boomers bust': Robert Kiyosaki warns that older Americans will get crushed in the 'biggest bubble in history' — 3 shockproof assets for instant insurance now\n\nSchiff, who said in June 2023 that his “net worth is a lot more than $80 million,” would fit within the Fed’s top 1% definition for Q4 2023 — but unlike some of his wealthy peers, the growth in his net worth was somewhat restricted by his investing philosophy, which is hyper-focused on gold.\n\nWhen quizzed by Patrick Bet-David, host of the PBD Podcast, about how much his net worth has increased over the past decade, Schiff said: “It’s hard to say. My investment portfolio has gone up. In fact, the non-gold portion over that time frame has done better. Now, my gold stocks did very well from 2000 to 2010-11, but over the last 10 years, I have bigger winners in the other half of my portfolio than I do in the gold stocks.”\n\nIf wealth generation was his sole focus, Schiff said he could have earned even more money by investing more heavily in the “Magnificent Seven,” all of which have dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 in the past decade.\n\n“I did not do that,” he said — and here’s why.\n\nSoaring stock portfolios ‘all artificial’\n\nSchiff believes the $44.6 trillion held by America’s top 1% is “all artificial [and] all on paper because of what we claim stocks are worth.”\n\nHe believes investors are simply “benefiting from the inflated asset price level” caused by the Fed’s monetary policy decisions in the past decade — specifically the low interest rate policy (hovering near 0%) in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and the two years prior.\n\n“Most of these Americans, if they tried to sell their stocks, the market would crash,” Schiff argued. “So, you have all these billionaires whose wealth is a function of the price of their stock. If they actually tried to sell their stock, it wouldn’t be that high.”\n\nGold, on the other hand, is a more stable investment, according to Schiff. In a possible scenario where the U.S. economy tanks and investors panic-sell their stocks, he believes gold is more likely to retain its purchasing power and protect your overall net worth.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nJeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe— you may want to do the same in 2024\n\n'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling rising costs — take advantage today\n\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof — and only getting worse.

        "text": "The world today is a geopolitical hot mess. One source of that messiness is a lack of consensus among scholars and policymakers about the global distribution of power. Do we still live in a world of U.S. hegemony? Is it a bipolar or multipolar world? Or are states no longer the globe’s key actors, and do we instead live in an age of “ technopolarity ,” where corporate titans such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and billionaire Elon Musk are the new great powers?\n\nThe world today is a geopolitical hot mess. One source of that messiness is a lack of consensus among scholars and policymakers about the global distribution of power. Do we still live in a world of U.S. hegemony? Is it a bipolar or multipolar world? Or are states no longer the globe’s key actors, and do we instead live in an age of “technopolarity,” where corporate titans such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and billionaire Elon Musk are the new great powers?\n\nThe academic cacophony is disturbing. Uncertainty about the distribution of power is not merely a matter of debate; when actors disagree about the distribution of power, wars can start.\n\nThe book covers of Underground Empire and Digital Empires by Henrey Farrell and Abraham Newman and Anu Bradford.\n\nTwo books published last year offer divergent takes on these questions. In Underground Empire: How America Weaponized the World Economy, Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman posit that the United States still wields a considerable amount of structural power in the global system. Anu Bradford’s Digital Empires: The Global Battle to Regulate Technology, however, argues that the surprising superpower is neither the United States nor China but the European Union.\n\nBoth books examine the exercise of power and governance in the digital sphere. Their contrasting evaluations help explain why it is so difficult for even the sharpest observers of global affairs to agree about the current state of the world—particularly when technology is involved.\n\nFarrell and Newman’s Underground Empire builds on the pair’s pathbreaking 2019 article in International Security, “Weaponized Interdependence: How Global Economic Networks Shape State Coercion.” In that paper, Farrell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, and Newman, a professor at Georgetown University, posited that, across many economic sectors, globalization generated a network structure that concentrated power in a few central nodes. States that controlled those nodes—such as the United States—could exercise considerable global influence.\n\nUnderground Empire reminds readers of the article’s core argument. In their introduction, the authors write, “The global economy relied on a preconstructed system of tunnels and conduits that the United States could move into and adapt, nearly as easily as if they had been custom-designed by a military engineer for that purpose. By seizing control of key intersections, the U.S. government could secretly listen to what adversaries were saying to each other or freeze them out of the global financial system.”\n\nUnderground Empire expands far beyond this point, however. There is an interesting discussion, for one, of how the private sector helped create this centralized world and the conditions under which multinational corporations have been willing extensions of federal power: “Entrepreneur after entrepreneur discovered that the best way to turn a profit in a decentralized economy was to figure out ways to centralize parts of it again.”\n\nBradford’s Digital Empires similarly builds on earlier work. Bradford draws from her 2020 book, The Brussels Effect, which argues that the EU’s combination of market power and technocratic capacity made it a superpower in issue areas where Europeans preferred stringent regulatory standards. In Digital Empires, Bradford, a professor at Columbia Law School, contends that there are three great powers when it comes to online technology—and each of them offers a different variety of digital capitalism. As she describes it, “the US has pioneered a largely market-driven model, China a state-driven model, and the EU a rights-driven model.”\n\nThese varying approaches lead to horizontal clashes between the United States, China, and the EU on regulatory and technological issues such as data privacy and content moderation. Divergent digital preferences also create vertical clashes between these governments and the tech companies supplying digital infrastructure and services. The Chinese state cowed its firms into greater compliance with government dictates; U.S. firms have been more willing to fight the federal government on questions of data privacy.\n\nA woman with short hair wearing a white top is seen through blurred light circles as she gestures with both hands.\n\nBoth Underground Empire and Digital Empires are analytically sharp and worth reading. Farrell and Newman pepper their narrative with entertaining anecdotes—such as the fact that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) labeled the internet’s international choke points after ski resorts. Bradford’s book is encyclopedic in its range; her discussion of global online policy disputes on issues including antitrust and artificial intelligence is comprehensive and useful for anyone wishing to read up on the subject matter.\n\nComparing and contrasting the authors’ arguments—as I am about to do—elides where they are in agreement. Both Underground Empire and Digital Empires stress the importance of institutional capacity as a means that states use to exercise power; some of Bradford’s arguments resemble those that Farrell and Newman made in their 2019 book, Of Privacy and Power. The new books also suggest that the concept of technopolarity does not have legs. After reading both books, one is likely to conclude that state power will be able to pressure the private sector into compliance on core national interests.\n\nNonetheless, what makes these books such interesting reading is where they diverge: the sources of state power in cyberspace.\n\nFor Farrell and Newman, Washington retains considerable structural power because so much of the digital world originated in the United States. This network centrality endows the United States with the ability to surveil, influence, and—if necessary—coerce other actors across multiple realms.\n\nAt least some of this was by design: The authors write that, during the early days of the internet, “[a]ccording to a former NSA employee, the U.S. government ‘quietly encourage[d] the telecommunications industry to increase the amount of international traffic that is routed through American-based switches’ to make it easier to spy on the world.” With China-U.S. tech competition heating up, Washington has employed unconventional measures to pressure China. These include the foreign direct product rule, which allows the United States to ban the export of products from other countries if those products rely on U.S.-made components or technology.\n\nOverall, Underground Empire suggests that some forms of structural power are extremely difficult to dislodge. As during the late 1980s—when many international relations scholars believed the United States was in terminal decline, only for the country to be the last superpower standing a decade later—commentators may be underestimating current U.S. power in the digital world.\n\nFor Bradford, however, what matters is the combination of market power, state capacity, and attractiveness of a government’s regulatory preferences. This formula enables her to predict that, going forward, the EU will be the most important democratic actor in global digital governance. The EU’s lack of big tech firms is a plus in Bradford’s model because it reduces the EU’s incentive to cater to domestic interest groups.\n\nAccording to Digital Empires, the laissez-faire market-based U.S. model of tech governance is losing its appeal both at home and abroad. Domestically, both major political parties have soured on Big Tech, albeit for different reasons. Democrats distrust the corporate concentration of Big Tech, while Republicans are convinced that content moderation has an anti-conservative bias. Globally, concerns about data privacy have made life more difficult for the Big Five tech firms—Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\nAs the U.S. model loses its luster, Bradford posits that the United States will align more closely with the EU against China’s more authoritarian model of digital governance. For Bradford, therefore, what matters is not control over critical nodes but control over critical markets.\n\nThe definitions of digital power proffered in Underground Empire and Digital Empires are not mutually exclusive. It can be simultaneously true that the United States retains considerable structural power and the EU exercises its market power adroitly—and all the while China tries to amass both forms of power. Still, if there are arenas of contestation where U.S., European, and Chinese officials disagree, whose form of power might prevail?\n\nHere, one would have to give a slight edge to Farrell and Newman and their argument in favor of U.S. structural power. Bradford’s case for the EU is weakened by a few empirical and theoretical claims that do not hold up. Her chapter on the “waning global influence of American techno-libertarianism” is normatively persuasive about the downsides of the U.S. model. Her claim that other democracies have turned against the U.S. model, however, relies almost entirely on criticisms levied by those countries after the 2013 Edward Snowden revelations rather than meaningful policy change.\n\nPhotographers swarm around a man wearing a suit with his back to the camera as he stands in front of a table to testify before members of the Senate Judiciary, seen in the distance.\n\nThere are two other areas where Bradford’s predictions are even more untenable. She suggests in her conclusion that “tech companies were reluctant to moderate content on their platforms but now increasingly concede they have a responsibility to do so more proactively.” This claim has not aged well. After Musk stripped Twitter’s content moderation team in 2022, other big tech firms followed suit. As the Washington Post reported last August, “[s]ocial media companies are receding from their role as watchdogs against political misinformation, abandoning their most aggressive efforts to police online falsehoods.” There is no sign of this trend abating during this record-breaking global year of elections.\n\nBradford also claims that the United States is moving toward the EU on AI regulations. “Artificial intelligence may well be the next frontier of the Brussels Effect,” she writes, adding that the EU’s AI regulation “may also serve as a template for other jurisdictions.” But a recent Politico story about the clash of EU and U.S. AI standards suggested a different outcome. EU member states such as France do not necessarily agree with Brussels. U.S. officials, along with Silicon Valley representatives, have also pushed back hard on EU standards. The result? “Heading into 2024, those who want a lighter touch appear to be winning, despite EU’s new binding rules on AI,” the Politico authors wrote.\n\nThe sources of power in cyberspace undoubtedly reside somewhere between Underground Empire and Digital Empires. It is possible, however, that they may also shift over time. Farrell and Newman’s argument holds considerable power for newer technologies as they emerge; what Underground Empire reveals is that geography matters even in cyberspace, particularly when the contours of any technological network remain somewhat obscured.\n\nAs time passes and technologies become more standardized, however, governments can also move down the learning curve. At these junctures, Bradford’s arguments about market power start to gain greater validity. This explains how both China and the EU remain great powers in a digital world.\n\nIn the end, what Underground Empire and Digital Empires suggest is that technology can help international relations theorists better understand the power debates that have haunted them since the days of Sparta and Athens.",

Well, the reason is that these 3 platforms are classified as ‘very large online companies’\n\nUnder the DSA, websites that receive more than 45 million users per month in the EU will be recognized as very large organizations (gatekeepers) and will face stricter rules.\n\nFor example, these sites will need to:\n\nMaintain a public database of all their ads\n\nMaintain a of all their ads Get independent audits at least once a year,\n\nGet at least once a year, Share their data with the Commission and other national agencies for monitoring purposes, and so on.\n\nShare their data with the Commission and other national agencies for monitoring purposes, and so on. Update their numbers (i,e, the total number of monthly users they get) every 6 months.\n\nIn case they have less than 45 million monthly users for the entire year, they will be removed from the list.\n\nThe reason for such stricter rules is pretty simple. The bigger a company is, the larger its user base and the influence it has on the public. Such power cannot be left unregulated.\n\nThe EU has earlier named six tech companies as ‘gatekeepers’ – Amazon, Google, Meta, Byte Dance, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\nA Little about the Digital Service Act\n\nThe DSA was first introduced in November 2022 and finally came into effect on August 25, 2023. It aims to create a safe and trustworthy online ecosystem in the EU.\n\nIt’s a user-centric directive that will ensure customer complaints are taken seriously, they have a pleasant online experience and the companies are transparent with their users.\n\nThere has been some resistance to the new rules. For example, companies like Amazon and Zalando claim that they have been wrongfully classified as very large online platforms, but the Commission is standing firm on its decisions so far. Even TikTok had challenged its status as a gatekeeper under the act.\n\nSo far, there have been no instances of any serious breach.

The Facebook founder might still be wearing the classic t-shirt and jeans, but he's recently opted to pair it with a chain necklace and New Balance sneakers.\n\nHitchcock told BI that Zuck's new style is part of a larger \"strategy\" over the last few years to \"make him approachable and show that he's a fun guy.\"\n\nHere's what Zuckerberg and his fellow wealthy tech titans are wearing this spring, according to style experts.\n\nThe shacket\n\nBill Gates, 68, remains on trend with what his fellow tech bosses are wearing. Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nIn March, Bill Gates was spotted in a navy top while sitting in the crowd of a tennis match. At first glance, it's a basic collared shirt, but the Microsoft founder is right on trend with the look the men of Silicon Valley are going for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It looks formal, like an old dress shirt, but they're actually knit, so it's got a much more casual vibe,\" Hitchcock said.\n\nSometimes referred to as a shacket, the top is thick enough to be considered outerwear but can be styled as a shirt on its own.\n\nIt's unclear exactly where Gates picked up his shacket.\n\nRelated stories\n\nHitchcock's clients, who include wealthy tech bosses in San Francisco, often opt for the luxury Italian brand Herno when purchasing similar clothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Bob's Watches CEO Paul Altieri said it's intentional that the top dogs are choosing to wear \"clothing that has no name at all\" on its exterior.

Getty Image; On; End Clothing\n\nGoogle founder Sergey Brin recently went down a red carpet wearing sneakers with his suit, and it's certainly not uncommon for tech execs to keep it casual.\n\n\"We have seen a decline in interest for limited edition sneakers, while interest in low-key luxury sneakers from George Esquivel and the Zegna Triple Stitch remain high,\" Nicole Pollard Bayme, CEO of LA-based styling firm Lalaluxe, said.\n\nThe New Balance sneakers — particularly popular with Gen Z right now — worn by Zuckerberg could be a hint that billionaires are also paying attention to current style trends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there's On, a brand that has more recently taken over the shopping lists of Hitchcock's clients over the last three years. Shoes from On go for less than $200.\n\nSporty sunglasses are in\n\nSunglasses from Nike cost around $100 on the website. Getty Images\n\nAs for accessories, sporty metal-frame sunglasses are a favorite for men, especially when billionaires are attending outdoor sporting events.\n\nIt's no surprise that Nike founder Phil Knight blocks the sun with his own brand, but the silhouette of the shades is a great example of today's trends.\n\n\"When they're watching sports, they're not going to wear higher-end quality tortoise frames,\" Hitchcock said. \"They go for metal, which is really funny because I don't think women switch out their glasses for sporting events.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe women in charge want kitten heels and expensive jewelry\n\nManolo Blahnik shoes go for around $900 brand new. Victoria Hitchcock; Oscar Heyman\n\nAs for her female clients, Hitchcock said they're going for understated shoe options and eye-catching jewelry.\n\nIt's kitten heels — oftentimes Manolo Blahnik — with their jeans and blazers completed with \"high-end luxury\" jewelry for the elite women of Silicon Valley.\n\nFor example, a cat's eye chrysoberyl gem ring with 26 diamonds from jeweler Oscar Heyman (pictured above) runs her clients about $320,000.",

        "text": "With seemingly fewer friends posting to their main Facebook and Instagram feeds, Meta has introduced a new feature its users can talk to: an AI chatbot. The feature, named Meta AI, is rolling out to the company’s main apps including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. It’s primarily a conversational chat window where you can ask questions and generate AI images, similar to other AI chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Co-Pilot and Google’s Gemini.\n\nDespite over a year of artificial intelligence being everywhere, this could be many people’s first interaction with the technology. Meta has billions of users across its apps, and anyone who has managed to avoid the bots so far will find this one nearly impossible to escape.\n\nWhy is this AI chatbot here?\n\nFacebook and Instagram users probably weren’t banging down Mark Zuckerberg’s door demanding an AI chatbot, so why is this feature suddenly everywhere? The technology is still new and its utility debatable. However, the major tech companies have decided that, like voice assistants and scrollable vertical videos before it, AI is the next big thing. Now they are competing to push out their versions. Facebook and Instagram used to rely on users’ friends, family and communities to keep their attention. Now, as these platforms are aging, the companies may hope a chatty bot can replace some of the human interaction.\n\nHow do I find it?\n\nThe chatbot is integrated in search and messaging features across Meta’s apps, and may appear in your feed under some posts as well. If you don’t see the AI features it yet, check back later. Its presence is marked with its logo: a thin ring that’s mostly blue and occasionally animated. The AI tool can also be accessed online on the stand-alone website meta.ai. It is not included in the company’s app for children, Messenger Kids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Facebook, tap the search icon on top and you’ll find that the usual search bar has been replaced with one that says, “Ask Meta AI anything.” As you start typing, it will auto-suggest searches. Anything with the blue circle next to it is going to bring up the AI chat window. You can also tap the messages icon and engage with Meta AI as if it’s another pal to talk to. If you see it under a post in your feed, it will suggest questions to ask related to the content you see.\n\nIn Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, you’ll also find Meta AI has taken over the search bars and appears as another chat. If your accounts are connected to each other, the Meta AI conversation should pick up where you left off, regardless of what app you’re in.\n\nHow do I turn it off?\n\nThere’s no way to get rid of Meta AI in search, confirmed Meta. In WhatsApp, there is an option to hide the new Meta AI button by going to Settings → Chats → Show Meta AI Button. However, it’s still in the search bar. Other apps have an option to mute its replies. I asked the AI chatbot how to turn it off and got multiple incorrect answers with instructions that did not work and for settings that don’t exist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can delete a chat with Meta AI to remove it from recent conversations in the same way you would any other chat. Swipe left on the chat and select Delete in Instagram, More → Delete on Facebook and Messenger, and More → Delete Chat on WhatsApp.\n\nHow do I get started?\n\nStart typing full sentences or random words in any of the apps’ search bars or in the conversations with Meta AI. If this is your first time using an AI chatbot, you can begin by asking simple questions and even for a list of ways to use it.\n\nI did the first things any normal person does when testing an AI tool. I asked it to be my pretend boyfriend, told it to generate images of ducks writing breakup letters and tried to push its boundaries. I discovered it avoids partaking in overtly sexual conversations or generating photos of the Pope (entirely unrelated questions). As with all artificial intelligence, there are creative ways to get around its filters.\n\nMeta AI includes options for shortcuts. Type a forward slash and command, like /joke:, /imagine: or /story: and type your description after. However, these aren’t really necessary since you can make the same requests in a conversational way, such as “tell me a story about depressed hamster who ran for mayor.”\n\nWhat should I use it for?\n\nAn AI chatbot is like having an enthusiastic but unreliable friend. You can ask it almost anything — but never assume it’s telling the truth. With that in mind, use Meta AI for fun and for noncritical tasks. Ask random questions like you would with Google, start conversations to feel less alone and use it to brainstorm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeta AI can also generate images, though in our tests they have the typical flaws associated with artificial intelligence. Most share the hyper-realistic lighting that AI images are known for, fumble details like fingers and eyes, and frequently give women exposed, ample cleavage.\n\nThere are plenty of other things you can try. Ask Meta AI to animate images, request a summary of the day’s news or ask it to take on the personality of a specific character when speaking to you. Because it’s integrated with Meta’s other products, you can use it to search things like “Reels of people learning to roller skate.”\n\nTo get the best results and avoid bland responses, ask follow-up questions and give as many details as possible. For a list of starter ideas, check out Tech Friend Shira Ovide’s recommendations of useful things to ask a chatbot.\n\nWhat should I not use it for?\n\nDon’t use AI as an authority for anything of consequence. For example, don’t rely on a chatbot for medical advice or as a source for school or work. Ethically, you shouldn’t use it to write papers for school, though Meta AI is happy to spit out wooden essays on demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExperts warn there is a danger of misinformation from tools like Meta’s chatbot. To steer clear, avoid using it as a go-to for anything sensitive or political. Turn to human sources instead like reporters, experts, even Wikipedia and Reddit, before artificial intelligence. For more advice on avoiding misinformation, check out our guide.\n\nHow is it different from other AI bots?\n\nFor the basics, Meta AI appears to spit out the same generic answers as its competitors. I asked five different chatbots about the best taqueria in San Francisco, a vegetarian meal plan, if God exists and how to know if a polycule is right for you. For the most part, they all gave incredibly similar, mundane but neutral answers with the exception of Microsoft’s Co-pilot, which does not enjoy shenanigans.\n\nIs it keeping my information?",

Part of its strength is its integration in widely used Meta apps, including WhatsApp. And that integration now involves super-fast image generation.\n\nMeta's demonstration of real-time AI image generation in WhatApp using Meta AI with Llama 3 (Image credit: Meta)\n\nMeta says it will soon roll out real-time AI image generation in beta for WhatsApp users in the US as well as in Meta AI for the web. Images will appear and change as users write prompts, immediately changing to reflect new words added to the prompt.\n\n“Imagine a soccer game on Mars,” begins the prompt in the demonstration video shared by Meta, and the AI-generated image appears to immediately change to show a football pitch in an alien landscape. It's the fastest AI image generation that we've seen so far. Of course, speed does not mean quality, and we've yet to see how Llama 3 image generation compares to the likes of Midjourney and OpenAI's DALL-E 3.\n\nMeta says images produced by Llama 3 are “sharper and higher quality” than in Llama 2, and the model is also better at rendering text – an improvement we've seen across almost all of the major AI image generators in the most recent updates. The model can also animate images and turn them into GIFs.\n\nLlama 3 will also be able to animate images in Meta AI (Image credit: Meta)\n\nThe new features are currently available to users with access to the beta version of Meta AI. As well as in WhatsApp, Meta’s AI assistant is being rolled out in Instagram and Facebook in English in Australia, Canada, Ghana, Jamaica, Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. There is also now a standalone browser-based version at Meta.ai, again limited to certain countries.\n\nReal-time Llama 3 AI image generation in Meta AI (Image credit: Meta Llama 3)\n\nMeta has also launched two freely available open-source Llama 3 models for developers: an 8-billion parameter and a 70-billion parameter model are both accessible on major cloud providers.\n\nGet the Creative Bloq Newsletter Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.

        "text": "Ignoring and blocking scam messages on WhatsApp is usually the safest move to avoid falling victim to cyber fraud. However, X user, who typically follows this practice, recently decided to reply to a scam message he received on the Meta-owned platform.\n\nAt first, he thought about giving the scammer a piece of his mind over the phone. But then, he opted to chat instead. Little did he expect that the conversation would take a surprising and somewhat heartwarming twist. The scammer ended up congratulating him on his upcoming wedding and even shared some valuable cyber security tips with him.\n\nX user Chetty Arun shared a thread with screenshots of his WhatsApp conversation with a scammer. In the chat, the scammer confessed to Arun about scamming people for the past decade and explained how APK files are used to take control of a victim's phone. Surprisingly, the scammer ended the conversation by wishing Arun good luck.\n\nI spoke with yet another scammer today. I don't know why I do this, but here we go.\n\n\n\nIt all started with a few annoying Whatsapp messages trying to scam me. But we ended up wishing each other good luck 😂\n\n\n\n1/n pic.twitter.com/Sm49J5XtNW — Chetty Arun (@ChettyArun) April 19, 2024\n\nIn a bizarre turn of events, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the CEO of Paytm, was also seen acknowledging the oddly helpful advice dispensed by a scammer. He retweeted the post and wrote, “You won’t stop till you read this full thread!”\n\nYou won’t stop till you read this full thread ! https://t.co/FD7yX69Xri — Vijay Shekhar Sharma (@vijayshekhar) April 19, 2024\n\n\"I swear this was more entertaining than any comedy show 😂😂,\" a user commented. Another one wrote, \"APK files are dead give away. But what to do with JPG files these guys send. Most people don't even know that simple photos or sometimes coded texts with no meaning can be used to infect.\" \"This was too good but also should be shared for public awareness,\" a user wrote.\n\n“More exciting story than any movie or web series,” commented a fourth. “He was so much interested in your DP that he asked 2-3 times,” added a fifth.\n\nWhatsApp is a great tool for communication, but cybercriminals try to use it for fraud. Here are some key ways to protect yourself:\n\nBe cautious with links and attachments:\n\nDon't open links or attachments from unknown senders. Scammers often use enticing offers or urgent messages to trick you into clicking.\n\nVerify the sender: If you receive a message from someone you don't know well, or if a friend or family member seems to be acting strangely, confirm their identity through a separate call or text.\n\nProtect your personal information:\n\nNever share personal or financial information on WhatsApp. This includes bank account details, passwords, and OTPs (one-time passwords).\n\nReview your privacy settings: Limit who can see your profile picture, \"About\" section, and \"Last Seen\" status. This reduces the information scammers can use to impersonate you.\n\nEnable extra security features:\n\nTurn on two-step verification: This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email when logging into WhatsApp on a new device.\n\nReport suspicious activity: If you receive a scam message, block the sender and report them to WhatsApp. This helps them track and remove fraudulent accounts.\n\nStay alert and informed:\n\nBe skeptical of messages offering free gifts, prizes, or deals that seem too good to be true. Scammers often use these tactics to lure victims.\n\nKeep your WhatsApp app updated: Updates often include security patches to fix vulnerabilities.",

        "text": "Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp, is rolling out a significant update to the web version of its ubiquitous messaging platform. More than just a cosmetic change, the redesign aims to enhance user experience by offering a more streamlined interface and increased cohesion with the WhatsApp desktop app and mobile versions.\n\nWhatsApp Web Gets a Facelift: Streamlining the Messaging Experience\n\nThis update signifies WhatsApp’s ongoing commitment to optimizing its service across all platforms. The company regularly incorporates user feedback and introduces new features, many of which are initially tested within the development, or beta, version of the app. This aligns with the recent beta release of a dedicated section for managing contacts and favorite chats.\n\nA Cleaner and More Intuitive Interface\n\nThe crux of the WhatsApp Web redesign lies in its revamped navigation system. The current design utilizes a top bar with buttons for various functions like accessing communities, viewing contact statuses, and initiating new messages.\n\nThe beta version, however, introduces a dedicated navigation bar on the left side of the screen. This bar provides quick and easy access to key sections: chats, communities, channels, statuses, archived chats, and starred messages. Previously, these functionalities were only accessible through a three-dot menu away in the top right corner.\n\nThis shift to a side-bar navigation offers a more intuitive and streamlined user experience. Users can now effortlessly switch between different functionalities without the need to navigate through menus or sub-menus.\n\nGizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram\n\nGradual Rollout and Consistency Across Platforms\n\nThe new WhatsApp Web design is currently available to beta testers. However, according to WaBetaInfo, a website known for tracking WhatsApp developments, the update will be progressively rolled out to a wider user base in the coming weeks.\n\nThis redesign reflects WhatsApp’s broader strategy of unifying the user experience across platforms. In 2023, the company streamlined the design of the Android app to match the iOS version. Similarly, the iPhone app recently underwent a makeover, replacing its blue accents with the signature green color that defines WhatsApp across all operating systems.\n\nThis focus on consistency strengthens user familiarity, allowing seamless transitions between desktop, web, and mobile versions. Users can expect the same basic functionalities and layouts, regardless of the device they choose to access WhatsApp on.\n\nA More Unified Future for WhatsApp\n\nThe redesign of WhatsApp Web represents another step towards Meta’s vision of creating a cohesive and user-friendly messaging experience across all platforms. As technology evolves and user needs change, we can expect further enhancements and functionalities to be available in the future.\n\nThis commitment to continuous improvement ensures that WhatsApp remains a dominant player in the communication landscape.",

        "text": "Since joining a community that dreams of an internet free from giant corporations that can exploit users' time and data, Victoria West's digital artwork has been exhibited across the globe.\n\nWest, a photographer and digital artist based in Burton, 30 kilometres southeast of Fredericton, has had her work shown in Paris, Rome, Barcelona, Townsville in northeastern Australia, Miami, New York City, and even a museum in Albuquerque, N.M., — all through connections she's made in Web3.\n\nWest warned it was a \"rabbit hole,\" but what she found in wonderland she doesn't believe she'd find anywhere else.\n\nWeb3 is a future version of the internet.\n\nWATCH | Step inside Eden's Dye, Victoria West's NYC exhibit: N.B. photographer explains how AI has freed her art from constraints Duration 2:23 The work of Victoria West, a photographer and digital artist based in Burton, was recently showcased at an immersive exhibit in the Big Apple.\n\nWeb1, West said, was the first version of the internet, in which users passively consumed information.\n\nAs the 2000s dawned, Web2 emerged, and users could now post their own content — think Twitter, blogs, YouTube. People are now creating more and more in digital spaces, but the downside of Web2 is that corporations are technically still the owners of all that creation, and they could take your data and potentially do with it as they please.\n\nEnter Web3, which still exists more in theory: nobody and everybody owns the internet. This version aims to be decentralized. It doesn't eradicate the distrust some people have in mega companies like Google and Meta — it just removes the need for it, because no one person or organization can own the blockchain Web3 operates on.\n\nWest said within Web3 there's an art movement, with artists working together and taking control of their work. Imagine if Leonardo da Vinci had an internet connection, as well as Raphael, Michelangelo and Donatello. It's the renaissance all over again, West said, except it's happening with digital art.\n\n\"And it's happening online on a much bigger scale.\"\n\nBefore learning about W3 in 2021, West said she was in a photography bubble.\n\nVictoria West designed this whole exhibit, including the floor. Working with a coder friend and two well-known actors and poets, Vincent D'Onofrio and Laurence Fuller, Eden's Dye became a multi-media experience. (Victoria West)\n\nPhotography isn't the art form West imagined herself pursuing when she was younger. But when she bought a camera after the first commercial digital models arrived on the market in the mid-2000s, she was hooked.\n\n\"I was bothering everybody around me to take their portrait,\" she said.\n\nShe built up her portraiture business, becoming involved with the Professional Photographers of Canada and competing in photography contests. Still, West didn't want to just capture moments — she wanted to make them.\n\nVictoria West created this piece of digital art, which was exhibited at The Crypt Gallery, another gallery in New York City. (Submitted by Victoria West)\n\nThat's when artificial intelligence came on the scene.\n\nWest was using Midjourney, a generative AI program, when it was still in beta testing. Around the same time she became involved with Web3, she experimented with blending AI-produced textures into her photography. In her business, AI quickened her workflow and allowed her to change backdrops and furniture.\n\nWhile creating a piece in 2023 called When I Die, West wanted to design a man underground with roots blossoming into a tree. Well, there aren't any blossoming trees in Canada in February, West joked — so she made the tree using AI.\n\n\"I feel like someone took handcuffs off me, and I'm free,\" she said.\n\nWest says technology will progress and the internet will change, but what she really wanted was for people to walk into Eden's Dye and be amazed by the experience. (Shane Fowler/CBC)\n\nLauren Cruikshank, an associate professor in culture and media studies at the University of New Brunswick, has spoken about the use of AI in universities, but she also thinks about it through an artistic lens.\n\nFrom the camera to spell check, Cruikshank said the same discussion happens with each new medium: how much of the artistry belongs to the artist, how much to the tools they're using?\n\n\"For some people where it gets uncomfortable is where the role of the human is minimal compared to how much the AI tool is creating or having creative influence,\" she said.\n\nWith AI, Cruikshank agreed there are degrees — there's a difference between prompting an AI to generate an image of a beautiful sunset and claiming it as your artwork and what West is doing, combining AI with her own artistry.\n\n\"That sounds really compelling to me,\" Cruikshank said.\n\nLauren Cruikshank is a professor in the media studies department at the University of New Brunswick. (Submitted by Lauren Cruikshank)\n\nWhen West first saw Lume Studios on Broadway in lower Manhattan, the place she'd eventually display Eden's Dye, her immersive art exhibit, she knew she wanted it immediately.\n\nShe collaborated on the exhibit with some of her Web3 friends. Los Angeles actors and poets Laurence Fuller and Vincent D'Onofrio wrote poetry to accompany each piece of art, which West created using both photography and AI. A coder friend joined the crew, and the result was a floor-to-ceiling immersive exhibit. West's collaborators also choreographed performances to complement the art, using music produced by AI.\n\n\"Why wouldn't I do that if I can?\" West asked. \"It's freeing, I think, and lets you push the boundaries of photography and what you can do with it.\"\n\nWhile the exhibit leaned heavily on romantic, classical themes and Baroque aesthetics, Eden's Dye is almost a premonition: minted, digital artwork taking up entire walls in people's homes, flowers growing from code, experiencing art in virtual realms.\n\nDemand will only grow, West said. Technology will progress and the internet will change. But what she really wanted was for people to walk into Eden's Dye and be amazed by the art they were experiencing.\n\n\"They came because of the art, and they were there enjoying the art. You don't really need to understand anything beyond that.\"",

What’s next from the performance team, you ask? Well, you need to read the article. haha.\n\nNick Diego announced that the Pattern Directory gets a refresh and is now powered by blocks. “Over the past few weeks, the Meta team has been working on a new theme for the Pattern Directory as part of a broader effort to establish a consistent design language across WordPress.org.

(Without a Plugin). “If you’ve been looking to enhance the look and feel of your website, using custom fonts is a great way to do it.” Rai wrote. She covers, upgraded to WordPress 6.5 , where to find the Font Manager, how to install Google fonts or Custom fonts, and how to select the new fonts for the site design.\n\nAnders Noren has a new free WordPress theme out on the repository!

Ryan Welcher published a tutorial on how to create an external project template for create-block. With that knowledge, you can make use of the create-block tool even more and tailor it to your developers needs. “A default template provides a standard configuration for creating simple blocks. The real power of create-block becomes evident when you start creating external project templates.” Welcher wrote.\n\nIn the episode of the ViewSource podcast, Exploring the Interactivity API in WordPress Part 1, Aurooba Ahmed and Brian Coords discuss the Interactivity API in WordPress. They explore how to use the API, the challenges they faced, and the benefits it provides. They also touch on JavaScript modules and how they are used in the context of the Interactivity API. The conversation ends with a discussion about future topics to cover in the series as they build out the plugin using the API.\n\nJason Adams, also has an opinion about the Interactivity API and calls it a noble attempt: “It’s entirely new and independent. It doesn’t build on what devs learned, nor does it use any existing directives API out there. This means that not only do developers have to learn a completely new API, but when they do, it doesn’t directly translate to anything else. Not only that, but you’re limited to whatever the API supports — it’s nowhere near as powerful or flexible as a raw React component. If you want to do more with it then the API itself will have to mature.” he wrote.\n\nNeed a plugin .zip from Gutenberg’s master branch?\n\nGutenberg Times provides daily build for testing and review.

        "text": "Ever since the days of the PlayStation Move, Wii Balance Board or the Xbox Kinect, software publishers have dreamed of finding the perfect way to entice unhealthy gamers to get off the couch and get active.\n\nIn an unlikely twist, it finally seems as though virtual reality, and in particular the Quest 3, is going to turn out to be the hardware to finally bring gamified fitness into the wider world.\n\nGetting fit with VR\n\nObviously, if you are a couch potato then any kind of activity is beneficial. You don’t need to take a HIIT class to get started, just any kind of calorie-burning exercise is going to be appreciated in the long run by your heart.\n\nIf you are starting out try a game that just makes you move around a bit. Something simple like Walkabout Mini Golf or the gentler levels of Beat Saber. Even a game such as Virtuoso will have you playing a virtual drum kit and flailing about a bit. You won’t turn into a ripped Adonis by doing it but you are at least prepping your heart for what’s to come.\n\nRemember, before undertaking any program of intensive exercise you should consult your doctor.\n\nBest workouts on Quest 3\n\nThere are so many Quest 3 fitness apps now it can be difficult to know what to choose, so we are going to give you three to start your fitness journey with and explain why they are the best below.\n\nThe Thrill of the Fight\n\nThis intensive boxing workout has been around since the days of the Quest 2 but the Quest 3 brings better tracking with it. There are several ways to work out here including heavy bags, speed balls, and sparring before you even start to think about a big fight and all will have you sweating buckets if you go at it.\n\nThe initial setup in The Thrill of the Fight sees you stepping on a virtual scale while the game calibrates your height and from there on you are in the gym. Your Quest 3 battery will be fine because it is unlikely you will last as long as it does before needing a well-earned break.\n\nFitXR\n\nFitXR was easy to recommend until recently but a lot of people have started to look elsewhere since it recently introduced the dreaded monthly subscription model – “I just wanna quit the gym!”\n\nThere is a seven-day free trial before you get tied into a yearly or monthly payment and the array of virtual classes from boxing, stretches to Zumba is mightily impressive. If you are all in on taking your Quest fitness seriously, look no further.\n\nLiminal\n\nYou should never forget your mental health when it comes to actually staying healthy and Liminal is a great step towards ticking that box as well as getting you moving and active. A curated set of experiences in the free tier are well worth trying out and there is a premium option if you want to buy into what it’s doing.\n\nAt the start of each experience you choose you need to rank how you are feeling and then again at the end and the game measures any improvements. It just feels really nice and the games range from high energy to chilled so you always have a mood-dependant choice.\n\nThey also feel like fun part-games too, and don’t last very long so can fit in when you need a quick boost. We really like Lininal.\n\nKeep hydrated\n\nIf you are working out regularly you will know the necessity of taking hydration on board. You won’t think twice about taking a swig from a water bottle. With a Quest 3 on life is not that simple as the simple act of drinking is generally blocked by the headset. Plan ahead and get a bottle with a straw, double tap the side of your headset to get into Passthrough mode, pick up the bottle, and drink away. You will get hotter than normal with a headset on so this is even more important than ever.\n\nCan you get fit with a Quest 3?\n\nYou can undoubtedly improve your fitness dramatically with the kinds of cardio you can do in the Quest 3. A look around the internet will reveal plenty of people with positive stories such as, “As someone who has lost over 100lbs with VR as my only real workout, I 100% recommend VR for it. VR changed my life!”\n\nAs with any fitness program, perseverance and getting over the tough first days are the keys to seeing real gains whether you are looking to improve your fitness, lose weight, or even boost your mental health.\n\nComment\n\nbyu/bondtradercu from discussion\n\ninOculusQuest\n\nCons to using VR to get fit\n\nThe biggest and really only issue that will definitely flare up is that of sweat. Any good workout requires you to build up a head of steam and wearing screens in a relatively heavy plastic encasing is going to make it worse.\n\nAs your forehead is one of the first places to start sweating anyway, encasing that in plastic exacerbates the issue so you probably need to take some steps to mitigate the problem, especially if you share your Quest 3 headset with other friends or family members. There’s a limit to how much of your DNA they want to inherit when they just want to play Walkabout Mini Golf next time.\n\nAmazon sells a number of replacement facial interfaces and cooling padding that you can swap in and out for your workouts. You can also buy packs of 100 facial covers which protect the Quest a little and are disposable.\n\nAnother thing you might think about is a cooling fan. You can get ones that go around your neck or the forthcoming pro headband from BoboVR for the Quest 3 has a fan built in.\n\nSpeaking of headbands, if you haven’t upgraded your Quest head strap yet you probably want to do so before taking off on a virtual marathon as the one that comes with it is rubbish and not stable at all. You don’t want your Quest flying across the room as you land that perfect uppercut in The Thrill of the Fight. Check out the premium straps from BoboVR would be our best advice.\n\nOther Meta Quest 3 Pages you may like",

        "text": "This week in the world of tech: Boston Dynamics unveiled a new robot, and while it terrified us, the barrage of negative Humane AI Pin reviews showed us that maybe the artificial intelligence uprising is perhaps further aware than we initially feared.\n\nBut maybe you’ve missed these or other major tech stories from this past week. No worries, because we’re here to help with a round-up of the eight biggest tech news stories from the last seven days.\n\nThere’s a lot to catch up on, so let’s get into it.\n\n8. The Humane AI Pin came… and flopped\n\n(Image credit: Humane)\n\nReviews for the first Humane AI pin came out this week, and they weren’t great – with the wearable being universally labeled as “unreliable.”\n\nMarques Brownlee released a video on his YouTube channel calling the AI gadget “the worst product i've ever reviewed... for now,” Mrwhosetheboss said \"It's not good,\" Bloomberg said “\"The design and interface are fatally flawed,\" and The Verge’s video interview featured frequent bouts of hysterical laughter because of how bad it found the Humane AI Pin to be.\n\nThere was also a very strange controversy on social media criticizing the critics – with much of the undeserved hate being directed at Brownlee, leading to him issuing a response – but the main thing was that while AI wearables do seem to be the future – with Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses getting Meta AI and the Nothing earbuds getting ChatGPT (more below) – the current tech isn’t where it needs to be right now.\n\n7. Boston Dynamics terrified us with its new humanoid robot\n\n(Image credit: Boston Dynamics)\n\nPerhaps someday we’ll ask, “Where were you when you first saw “New Atlas?”\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox Get the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nBoston Dynamics all-new and all-electric Atlas update is a generational leap from the more than decade-old hydraulics-based Atlas. That robot, which is being retired was amazing in its own right, capable of doing numerous human-like tasks like walking, running, bending, and lifting, but also showing us how an apex human could perform through various acrobatics and parkour antics.\n\nNew Atlas, however, might be even stronger and it’s already showing us its uncanny flexibility in a brief introduction video. Expect to see it doing even more impressive physical tricks before the bot finally makes its way to factories and, maybe someday, our homes.\n\nRead more: Boston Dynamics reveals its most astonishing humanoid robot so far\n\n6. We saw Sony’s new mini-LED TV backlight tech put OLEDs on notice\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nSony just launched its new 2024 TVs, and the Bravia 9 mini-LED leads the lineup. Positioning mini-LED as its flagship TV tech is an extreme about-face for the company, which had previously reserved that status for OLED.\n\nWe saw the new Bravia 9 TV in action at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California, and there’s good reason for Sony’s newfound mini-LED enthusiasm. The company has developed a new XR Backlight Master Drive backlight design that uses a 22-bit LED driver to deliver 50% higher brightness and 320% more local dimming zones than its previous X95L mini-LED model.\n\nThis new backlight helps enhance contrast and color brightness while reducing blooming, closing the picture quality gap between mini-LED and OLED.

Samsung confirmed its AI is coming to your Galaxy 21 phone\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nSamsung has not only teased that Galaxy AI features are coming to the Galaxy S22 series soon, but it seemingly revealed this week that its 2021 flagship phones will get a couple of Galaxy AI tools too.\n\nPer a post on Samsung’s Korean community forum the Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21 Plus, Galaxy S21 Ultra, Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Galaxy Z Fold 3 will be getting the company’s AI-packed One UI 6.1 update in “early May,” and when it does it’ll bring Circle to Search and Magic Rewrite to these devices.\n\nIt’s always great news to hear older handsets will be getting some of the technical bells and whistles of the newer smartphone releases, though if you’re rocking a Samsung handset from 2020 it looks unlikely you’ll get any of these AI tools – so we’d suggest checking out our Samsung phones deals page if you’re thinking of upgrading to a new phone that can access Galaxy AI.\n\nRead more: Samsung Galaxy S21 phones are getting two big Galaxy AI features\n\n4. New Nothing Ear buds launched with ChatGPT\n\n(Image credit: Nothing)\n\nNothing’s naming strategy is anything but self-explanatory, so to avoid supplementary confusion: Nothing launched two new sets of true wireless earbuds on Thursday, April 18. A model called just Ear are the company’s new flagship offering – these have arrived after the Ear (1), Ear (Stick) and Ear (2), that’s just how it is – while the also-new Ear (a) are the cheaper pair. And it’s this entry-level model that just gained a highly coveted TechRadar five-star recommendation, which you can read about to your heart’s content in our full-fat Nothing Ear (a) review.\n\nBut the fact that there are two new sets of Nothing earbuds is only part of the news here, because in addition to releasing two new earbuds models, Carl Pei’s startup has also fixed it so that your Nothing earbuds and phones can let you talk to ChatGPT for instant AI support.\n\nNothing says that once you’ve downloaded the ChatGPT app on your Nothing Phone (running the latest Nothing OS), you’ll be able to pinch-to-speak using the earbuds’ stems and thus summon the chatbot for answers, without having to dig out your device. And have to admit, that’s really something, Nothing…\n\n3. Meta rolled out its new AI – and it might bury Google and Microsoft\n\n(Image credit: Meta)\n\nMeta’s AI got a new and improved website, as well as some upgrade thanks to it’s new “state-of-the-art Llama 3 AI model” according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg – and the best thing of all is it’s completely free to use.\n\nThe site lets you generate text and images with a written prompt – though to make AI images you'll need to log in and your picture will feature a watermark which should help a little in cutting down misuse.\n\nIt’s still early days in the battle between AI creators, but Google and OpenAI had better watch out because Meta’s new and improved software is already looking like a major competitor to what’s currently out there – and it will only get better.\n\n2. The iPhone got its first Nintendo emulators and alternative app stores\n\n(Image credit: AltStore)\n\nFollowing some gentle arm-twisting from the EU, Apple recently said its App Store would soon allow retro game emulators like the ones you can find on Android. This week, we saw the first one arrive with Delta – a free app that you can download now from the App Store in the EU and many countries outside of it.\n\nUnlike rival emulators like iGBA, which quickly disappeared from the App Store due to copyright violations, this one is likely here to stay. Delta supports several consoles including the NES, SNES, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS, and you can play games with iPhone-compatible controllers, too. All you need to do is provide the ROM files (as long they’re copyright-free, of course) and you’re good to go. Now all we need is a PS1 emulator…\n\n1. The Insta360 X4 became our new favorite 360 camera\n\n(Image credit: Insta360)\n\nOur extensive Insta360 X4 hands-on review waxed lyrical about the 8K video-equipped 360-degree camera. With higher resolution video than the X3, much better battery life and welcome design tweaks, the X4 is the best 360-degree camera yet.\n\nFull waterproofing and a decent single-camera mode make the X4 a compelling action camera, vlogging tool, and even a dash cam especially for motorcyclists who can voice command the X4 from a Bluetooth compatible headset from within a helmet. GoPro has a tough act to follow with its upcoming Max 2, as does Canon with its intriguing 360 / 180 3D Powershot concept. It’s been really quiet in this category of cameras the last couple of years, but that seems set to change in 2024.",

        "text": "Facebook parent Meta Platforms has unveiled a new set of artificial intelligence systems that are powering what CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls \"the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.\"\n\nBut as Zuckerberg's crew of amped-up Meta AI agents started venturing into social media in recent days to engage with real people, their bizarre exchanges exposed the ongoing limitations of even the best generative AI technology.\n\nOne joined a Facebook moms group to talk about its gifted child. Another tried to give away nonexistent items to confused members of a Buy Nothing forum.\n\nMeta, along with leading AI developers Google and OpenAI, and startups such as Anthropic, Cohere and France's Mistral, have been churning out new AI language models and hoping to convince customers they've got the smartest, handiest or most efficient chatbots.\n\nWhile Meta is saving the most powerful of its AI models, called Llama 3, for later, on Thursday it publicly released two smaller versions of the same Llama 3 system and said it's now baked into the Meta AI assistant feature in Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nAI language models are trained on vast pools of data that help them predict the most plausible next word in a sentence, with newer versions typically smarter and more capable than their predecessors. Meta's newest models were built with 8 billion and 70 billion parameters — a measurement of how much data the system is trained on. A bigger, roughly 400 billion-parameter model is still in training.\n\n\"The vast majority of consumers don't candidly know or care too much about the underlying base model, but the way they will experience it is just as a much more useful, fun and versatile AI assistant,\" Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, said in an interview.\n\n'A little stiff'\n\nHe added that Meta's AI agent is loosening up. Some people found the earlier Llama 2 model — released less than a year ago — to be \"a little stiff and sanctimonious sometimes in not responding to what were often perfectly innocuous or innocent prompts and questions,\" he said.\n\nBut in letting down their guard, Meta's AI agents have also been spotted posing as humans with made-up life experiences. An official Meta AI chatbot inserted itself into a conversation in a private Facebook group for Manhattan moms, claiming that it, too, had a child in the New York City school district. Confronted by group members, it later apologized before the comments disappeared, according to a series of screenshots shown to The Associated Press.\n\n\"Apologies for the mistake! I'm just a large language model, I don't have experiences or children,\" the chatbot told the group.\n\nOne group member who also happens to study AI said it was clear that the agent didn't know how to differentiate a helpful response from one that would be seen as insensitive, disrespectful or meaningless when generated by AI rather than a human.\n\n\"An AI assistant that is not reliably helpful and can be actively harmful puts a lot of the burden on the individuals using it,\" said Aleksandra Korolova, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton University.\n\nClegg said Wednesday that he wasn't aware of the exchange. Facebook's online help page says the Meta AI agent will join a group conversation if invited, or if someone \"asks a question in a post and no one responds within an hour.\" The group's administrators have the ability to turn it off.\n\nNeed a camera?\n\nIn another example shown to the AP on Thursday, the agent caused confusion in a forum for swapping unwanted items near Boston. Exactly one hour after a Facebook user posted about looking for certain items, an AI agent offered a \"gently used\" Canon camera and an \"almost-new portable air conditioning unit that I never ended up using.\"\n\nMeta said in a written statement Thursday that \"this is new technology and it may not always return the response we intend, which is the same for all generative AI systems.\" The company said it is constantly working to improve the features.\n\nIn the year after ChatGPT sparked a frenzy for AI technology that generates human-like writing, images, code and sound, the tech industry and academia introduced 149 large AI systems trained on massive datasets, more than double the year before, according to a Stanford University survey.\n\nThey may eventually hit a limit, at least when it comes to data, said Nestor Maslej, a research manager for Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\"I think it's been clear that if you scale the models on more data, they can become increasingly better,\" he said. \"But at the same time, these systems are already trained on percentages of all the data that has ever existed on the internet.\"\n\nMore data — acquired and ingested at costs only tech giants can afford, and increasingly subject to copyright disputes and lawsuits — will continue to drive improvements. \"Yet they still cannot plan well,\" Maslej said. \"They still hallucinate. They're still making mistakes in reasoning.\"\n\nGetting to AI systems that can perform higher-level cognitive tasks and common-sense reasoning — where humans still excel— might require a shift beyond building ever-bigger models.\n\nSeeing what works\n\nFor the flood of businesses trying to adopt generative AI, which model they choose depends on several factors, including cost. Language models, in particular, have been used to power customer service chatbots, write reports and financial insights, and summarize long documents.\n\n\"You're seeing companies kind of looking at fit, testing each of the different models for what they're trying to do and finding some that are better at some areas rather than others,\" said Todd Lohr, a leader in technology consulting at KPMG.\n\nUnlike other model developers selling their AI services to other businesses, Meta is largely designing its AI products for consumers — those using its advertising-fueled social networks. Joelle Pineau, Meta's vice president of AI research, said at a recent London event that the company's goal over time is to make a Llama-powered Meta AI \"the most useful assistant in the world.\"\n\n\"In many ways, the models that we have today are going to be child's play compared to the models coming in five years,\" she said.\n\nBut she said the \"question on the table\" is whether researchers have been able to fine-tune its bigger Llama 3 model so that it's safe to use and doesn't, for example, hallucinate or engage in hate speech. In contrast to leading proprietary systems from Google and OpenAI, Meta has so far advocated for a more open approach, publicly releasing key components of its AI systems for others to use.\n\n\"It's not just a technical question,\" Pineau said. \"It is a social question. What is the behavior that we want out of these models? How do we shape that? And if we keep on growing our model ever more in general and powerful without properly socializing them, we are going to have a big problem on our hands.\"",

        "title": "Experiences of physical and emotional intimate partner violence during the COVID-19 pandemic: a comparison of prepandemic and pandemic data in a longitudinal study of Australian mothers",
        "text": "STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY Strengths of this study include recruitment of a community cohort of first-time mothers in early pregnancy, the longitudinal design, and repeated measurement of the 12-month period prevalence of physical and emotional intimate partner violence (IPV).\n\nEmbedded follow-up of a subsample of women during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic provided the capacity to compare women’s experiences during the pandemic with prepandemic data.\n\nA relatively small proportion (n=520, 34.5%) of the original cohort participated in the COVID-19 substudy, and the analytic sample for this study comprised 422 women (28.0%) who completed the measure of IPV at all four time points.\n\nSelective participation in the COVID substudy is likely to have biased prevalence estimates for IPV and mental health problems downwards.\n\nIntroduction In May 2020, the United Nations launched a campaign to raise awareness of the disproportionate impacts of lockdowns on women, including the increasing incidence of intimate partner violence (IPV), described as the ‘shadow pandemic’.1 Lockdown measures were enacted by governments to limit the risk and rate of COVID-19 infection in the community. In Melbourne, Australia this involved the longest period of cumulative lockdown measures globally, totalling 263 days including 111 consecutive days between July and October 2020.2 The highest level of restrictions included widespread school and business closures with just four approved reasons for leaving the home (essential shopping, 1 hour of daily exercise, care or caregiving and authorised work or education), movement limited to 5 km from home and an overnight curfew (21:00 to 5:00). These measures were largely effective in limiting disease transmission in the first two years of the pandemic.3 However, while Australia has experienced relatively low mortality per capita from COVID-19,4 the social implications of extended lockdowns have included high levels of underemployment or unemployment, financial stress, increased alcohol consumption and high levels of poor mental health.5 The longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on families will take time to uncover, however, many parents reported that the extra caregiving responsibilities and additional family, financial and health stresses associated with the pandemic were challenging.6 Women typically shoulder the greater share of caregiving, and research suggests that the pandemic had a greater impact on women in this respect, especially mothers.1 7 Some families reported a strengthening of relationships, however, increases in conflict, strained relationships and mental health problems among parents and young people were also common.8–10 In a cohort of families experiencing social adversity, family resilience was associated with better mental health for both mother and child during the pandemic, while conversely financial and family stress were associated with poorer mental health.11 Early pandemic data from population-based studies revealed high levels of depression, anxiety and alcohol and substance use among both parents and adolescents.12 13 The increased prevalence of mental health problems coincided with an overwhelmed healthcare system, a shift from face-to-face care to telehealth services, and concerns about contracting COVID-19 from services.14 In Australia, most general practitioners, psychologists and psychiatrists operate from private practices, with fees partially subsidised by the government. The financial impacts of the pandemic contributed to Australian parents postponing their medical and mental health care.9 10 Long-standing issues in private practices such as long wait times, fees well above the government subsidy and practices not taking new referrals15 worsened with the onset of the pandemic.16 17 Despite women having frequent contact with primary healthcare services (around six times per year for women of childbearing age),18 19 very few women experiencing IPV and/or mental health problems discuss these issues with health professionals.20 Many women face barriers to accessing services including financial constraints and lack of transportation, with added barriers to disclosing IPV such as concerns about confidentiality, normalisation of their experiences or choosing not to share them and fear of their partner.21–23 Periods of stay-at-home orders provided significant additional barriers to accessing services and clinicians, as well as support from friends or family.24 Social isolation during the pandemic, in particular confinement to the home, potentially increased the risks for women experiencing IPV.25 Qualitative research found that for women living with an abusive partner, home isolation further exacerbated or enabled their partner’s controlling and restrictive behaviours, while women who were separated from or not living with their partner felt safer.26 Some impacts of the pandemic amplified risk factors for men’s use of partner violence, including career and life stress, depressive symptoms and alcohol use.27 The most recent Personal Safety Survey (PSS), an Australian cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted between March 2021 and May 2022. The prevalence of both physical and emotional IPV across Australia and within Victoria was lower than the previous wave in 2016.28 This is in contrast with other pandemic data from crime statistics and emergency, health and support services. For example, Australian media outlets reported a 75% increase in google searches related to IPV and a greater number of calls to IPV helplines.29 Police data from Melbourne showed a 9% increase in IPV reports in 2020, however, the data did not rise and fall in line with the level of restrictions.30 International reports also showed a greater volume of calls to support lines and police reports related to IPV.31 A meta-analysis of 37 estimates from 18 studies across 7 countries reporting on crime or police data concluded that stay-at-home orders were associated with an increase in IPV.32 The majority of estimates (29/37) showed an increase in IPV during the pandemic, while the remaining 8/37 estimates indicated a decrease in IPV. As has been widely noted,30 32 such data underestimate the true prevalence of IPV as only a small proportion of women experiencing IPV have contact with police. Existing population-based research reporting changes in the prevalence of IPV has predominantly relied on women’s retrospective report of their experiences prior to the onset of the pandemic.33 Such research has shown both increases and decreases in the overall prevalence of IPV, as well as in different types of IPV since the onset of the pandemic.28 34–36 Australian data showed an increase in the prevalence of IPV in the first year of the pandemic, with many women retrospectively reporting that they had not experienced IPV previously.24 A systematic review identified just two studies with IPV measured prior to and during the pandemic,36 while a rapid review of literature published in the first year of the pandemic did not identify any longitudinal studies.37 An early pandemic study by Steinhoff et al 38 of young adults in Switzerland (N=786, 58% women) examined physical violence against household members at four time points prior to and one during the pandemic. Steinhoff et al 38 reported that young men’s use of violence increased over the lockdown period. Given participants were aged around 22 years, with just 1 in 10 living with a partner (9.8%), very little of this violence was IPV. A further limitation is that different approaches were used prior to and during the pandemic. Six items from the Conflict Tactics Scales39 were used to measure violence in dating relationships prior to the pandemic (2018) and were then subsequently used to assess violence against any household member during the pandemic. Chiaramonte et al 40 recruited 406 women in the USA who had sought help for IPV and were experiencing housing insecurity. Interviews about physical, emotional, sexual and economic abuse were conducted at four 6-month intervals using an investigator-adapted version of the Composite Abuse Scale (CAS) and the revised Scale of Economic Abuse.41 The mean score for all types of IPV decreased from baseline to the onset of the pandemic, after which no significant differences were observed, suggesting the pandemic may have disrupted the decrease in IPV. The authors noted that results are unlikely to be generalisable due to the specific context of participants (ie, housing insecurity and connection with services). To clarify these conflicting findings, evidence using repeated measurement of IPV prior to and during the pandemic is urgently needed to shape health and social care responses post pandemic and to prepare for future events. The present study draws on data from an Australian prospective cohort of 1507 first-time mothers and their first-born children followed up over 18 years, spanning the pandemic (the Mothers’ and Young Peoples’ Study, MYPS).42 A fast response COVID-19 substudy was conducted between mid-2020 and early-2021. A standardised measure of physical and emotional IPV was included in prepandemic follow ups (1, 4 and 10 years post first birth) and in the pandemic sub study (14–17 years post birth). In the present study, these longitudinal data have been used to (1) establish the prevalence of IPV at four time points prior to and during the pandemic; (2) estimate the proportion of women experiencing IPV who reported depressive or anxiety symptoms prior to and during the pandemic and (3) estimate the proportion of women experiencing IPV who disclosed these experiences to others prior to and during the pandemic. We hypothesised that there would be an increase in the prevalence of IPV during the first year of the pandemic, and that a greater proportion of women experiencing IPV during the pandemic would report clinically significant depressive or anxiety symptoms compared with prepandemic time points. We also expected to identify less disclosure of IPV experiences to doctors, friends or family during the pandemic.\n\nMethods Study design and participants Women registered to give birth to their first child were recruited through six public hospitals in Melbourne, Australia between 2003 and 2005. Hospital staff identified eligible women (≥18 years, nulliparous, ≤24 weeks gestation, English language proficiency) and mailed invitations including study information, plain language statement, consent form, baseline questionnaire and a reply-paid envelope. Participants were followed up at 1, 4 and 10 years postpartum. A COVID-19 substudy was conducted between June 2020 and April 2021 where participants completed surveys through REDCap. Further study details have been described elsewhere. 42 43 Patient and public involvement A small pilot group of women provided feedback on draft questionnaires and study procedures prior to study commencement and at each wave of follow-up. Participants are kept informed of study results via a study e-newsletter and a study website. Participant advisory groups have been established to support ongoing follow-up of the cohort. These mother and young people advisory groups are contributing to the design of follow-up procedures and will be involved in future reporting and dissemination of research findings. Study measures Experiences of IPV and disclosure The 18-item CAS44 was included in all four waves of follow-up. Women were asked to report on experiences with a current or former partner in the previous 12 months (0 ‘never’ to 5 ‘daily’). The CAS has demonstrated validity for assessing the prevalence of IPV.44 Recommended scale cut-points were used to identify: physical abuse ≥1 points (eg, ‘threw me’), emotional abuse ≥3 points (eg, ‘blamed me for causing their violent behaviour’, ‘tried to convince my friends, family or children that I was crazy’) and physical and emotional abuse.45 Immediately following the CAS, women were asked ‘Have you told anyone about the above experiences?’. Response options included telling their local doctor/general practitioner, a family member, friend, someone else, or not telling anyone. Maternal mental health During the pandemic and at 10-year follow-up, maternal depressive symptoms were assessed using the 20-item Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale.46 A cut point of ≥20 was used to identify probable major depression, in line with previous studies demonstrating that this cut-point has good sensitivity and specificity for identifying depression in community samples.47 In the first-year and fourth-year following childbirth, maternal depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).48 The recommended cut-point of ≥13 was used to identify probable major depression.48 The EPDS has been shown to have good sensitivity and specificity for identifying major depression in an Australian sample of postpartum women49 and has also been validated for use in non-postnatal populations.50 During the pandemic, anxiety was measured using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale-7.51 Participants reported on how often seven symptoms bothered them in the last 2 weeks (0 ‘not at all’ to 3 ‘nearly every day’). A cut-point of ≥10 was used to identify probable generalised anxiety, having demonstrated excellent reliability and validity.51 The Beck Anxiety Inventory was used to measure anxiety at 10-year follow-up, where participants reported the impact of 21 symptoms in the previous month (0 ‘not at all’ to 3 ‘severely’). The recommended cut-point of ≥16 was used to indicate the presence of clinically significant anxiety symptoms.52 53 In the first-year and fourth-year following childbirth anxiety was measured with a single item: ‘Have you experienced intense anxiety or panic attacks during the past 3 months?’. The four response options were dichotomised: ‘never’ or ‘rarely’ versus ‘occasionally’ or ‘often’. Cohort characteristics At enrolment (M=15 weeks gestation) women reported their date and country of birth, relationship status, highest educational qualification, employment status and annual income. Relationship status and having a healthcare concession care also were collected in subsequent follow-ups. Statistical analyses Data are drawn from 422 women who answered questions about IPV at 1 year, 4 years and 10 years postpartum and during the pandemic. The representativeness of this analytic sample was assessed in comparison to the original cohort at enrolment, and at 1-year, 4-year and 10-year follow-up. Univariable logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs for participation in relation to maternal sociodemographic characteristics, mental health and experiences of IPV. The 12-month period prevalence of physical IPV (with or without emotional IPV) and emotional IPV alone was estimated with 95% CIs at three time points prior to the pandemic (1, 4 and 10 years after the birth of their first child) and once during the pandemic (14–17 years postbirth) (aim 1). At these four time points, we also estimated the proportion of women experiencing IPV who reported depressive or anxiety symptoms (aim 2) and disclosed their experiences of IPV to health professionals, friends and family members (aim 3).\n\nResults Participants Sample retention from enrolment in early pregnancy to 1-year postpartum was 90.0% (figure 1). Following re-consent, 73.1% women participated at 4 years and 63.2% at 10 years (figure 1). Invitations to participate in the COVID-19 substudy were sent to 1098 women, however, 414 were not successful contacts (eg, email bounced, incorrect contact details, non-responsive). Thus, 684 women were known to have received an invite, with 520 (76%) participating—34.5% of the original cohort (figure 1). Figure 1 Flow chart of participation. Comparison of sociodemographical characteristics of the analytic sample and the full cohort are provided in online supplemental table 1. Compared with the full cohort, women in the analytic sample were less likely to be born overseas in a country where English is not the first language and more likely to be older, tertiary educated, partnered, employed or studying and on a higher income (≥$AUD60 000) in early pregnancy. They were also less likely to have a healthcare concession card (indicator of low income) in the 1st, 4th or 10th year of motherhood. Compared with the full cohort, women in the analytic sample were less likely to have experienced IPV in the year following childbirth. Supplemental material [bmjopen-2023-081382supp001.pdf] The sociodemographic characteristics of the analytic sample of 422 who completed the CAS at all four time points (28.0% of the original cohort) are shown in table 1. The majority (80.6%) of participants were residing in metropolitan Melbourne during the first year of the pandemic, with a further 10.7% living in regional Victoria, 6.9% living interstate and 1.9% overseas. The State of Victoria and metropolitan Melbourne specifically experienced the greatest government restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, including school and business closures and stay-at-home orders. Table 1 Maternal sociodemographic characteristics, experiences of depressive symptoms and IPV (n=422) IPV prior to and during the pandemic The 12-month period prevalence of physical and emotional IPV at each wave is shown in figure 2. The prevalence of physical and emotional IPV was greatest during the COVID-19 pandemic (17.5%; 95% CI 14.2% to 21.5%), compared with previous waves of follow-up at 10 years (14.4%; 95% CI 11.4% to 18.1%), 4 years 13.7% (95% CI 10.8% to 17.4%) and in the year following childbirth (10.2%; 95% CI 7.6% to 13.5%). Figure 2 The 12-month period prevalence of physical and emotional IPV in each wave of follow-up (n=422). IPV, intimate partner violence. Almost one in three women experiencing IPV during the pandemic (22/74=29.7%; 95% CI 20.4 to 41.1) had not previously reported experiences of IPV. The majority of women who reported IPV for the first time during the pandemic (n=20, 90.9%) experienced emotional IPV alone. The prevalence of emotional IPV alone was highest during the pandemic at 14.4% (95% CI 11.4% to 18.2%) compared with 9.5% (95% CI 7.0% to 12.7%) at 10 years, 9.2% (95% CI 6.8% to 12.4%) at 4 years, and 5.9% (95% CI 4.0% to 8.6%) in the year following childbirth (figure 2). In contrast, the prevalence of physical IPV was lowest during the pandemic (3.1%, 95% CI 1.8% to 5.0%) compared with the 1st, 4th and 10th year following childbirth (4.3%, 4.5% and 5.0%, respectively) (figure 2). Mental health and IPV prior to and during the pandemic One in four women (25.2%) experienced depressive symptoms during the pandemic. More than half of these women (n=61, 57.5%) had not reported depressive symptoms previously. As shown in figure 3, there was a gradual increase in the proportion of women experiencing IPV who reported concurrent depressive symptoms: from 16.3% (95% CI 7.9% to 30.5%) at 1-year postpartum to 22.4% (95% CI 13.5% to 34.9%) at 4-year follow-up, 31.1% (95% CI 20.8% to 43.8%) at 10-year follow-up and 52.7% (95% CI 41.4% to 63.8%) during the pandemic.

Almost one in seven women (13.6%) experienced anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. More than half of these women (n=33, 57.9%) had not reported anxiety symptoms previously. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms among women experiencing IPV increased with each wave of follow-up: from 4.8% (95% CI 1.2% to 17.2%) at 1-year postpartum to 15.5% (95% CI 8.3% to 27.2%) at 4-year follow-up, 21.3% (95% CI 12.8% to 33.4%) at 10-year follow-up and 27.0% (95% CI 18.1% to 38.2%) during the pandemic (figure 4).

Disclosure of IPV Directly following administration of the CAS44, women were asked whether they had talked to health professionals, family or friends about their experiences (table 2). A greater proportion of women told friends or family about their experiences of IPV during the pandemic compared with prior to the pandemic (74.7% vs 60.6% at 10-year follow-up). In contrast, a smaller proportion of women had talked to a doctor about their experiences of IPV during the pandemic compared with prior to the pandemic (6.8% vs 11.5% at 10-year follow-up). Approximately one in five women reported that they had not told anyone about their experiences: 19.7% at 10-year follow-up and 21.6% during the pandemic. Table 2 Proportion of women experiencing IPV who disclosed their experiences to their doctor, family, friends or others\n\nDiscussion Our findings suggest that a greater proportion of women experienced emotional IPV during the pandemic (when their first child was aged 14–17 years), compared with the 1st, 4th and 10th year of motherhood. Around one in three women reported IPV for the first time during the pandemic, predominantly reporting emotional IPV alone. This supports Australian cross-sectional survey data showing that many women who were experiencing IPV reflected that they had not experienced IPV prior to the pandemic.24 In Australia, IPV is more common among women aged 18–34 years compared with women aged 35 and over, with the prevalence of IPV exposure decreasing as age increases.54 The mean age of participants at the time of the COVID-19 substudy was 47 (with just two participants aged under 35 years). Outside of the pandemic context, we would have anticipated lower prevalence of IPV at this stage of life compared with previous waves.54 Our findings support the contention that the pandemic context contributed to higher prevalence of emotional IPV. Evidence of an increase in IPV during the pandemic has largely drawn on crime statistics, police reports and contact with family violence support services.30 32 We found an increase in the prevalence of emotional IPV alone. Given police responses to family violence typically result from an incident of physical violence, it is not likely that many of these experiences led to contact with police. These findings suggest that evidence from such sources may be the tip of the iceberg in terms of the prevalence of IPV. We also expect that the prevalence of IPV we observed during the pandemic to be an underestimate of the prevalence in the wider community. There is a known association between social disadvantage and IPV, including recent evidence of an association between financial stress or hardship and IPV during the pandemic.55 The women included in the analytic sample in the present study were highly educated, and women with lower income and experiences of IPV in the first year postpartum are under-represented compared with the original cohort. Men’s previous use of violence in a relationship is a predictor of IPV,27 and previous analyses of data for this cohort show that IPV in the year following childbirth is strongly associated with subsequent experiences of IPV.56 In line with qualitative evidence8 and population-based research,12 a higher proportion of women experienced depressive and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic compared with the 1st, 4th and 10th year of motherhood. Previous analyses of this cohort have shown that both physical and emotional IPV and emotional IPV alone are associated with poor mental health.56 Importantly, our findings suggest that women experiencing IPV during the pandemic (which was largely emotional IPV alone) were more likely to be experiencing depressive symptoms compared with women experiencing IPV in the first decade of motherhood. It will be important for research to determine whether the prevalence of emotional IPV and associated mental health problems remain elevated beyond the pandemic. There is also a broader need for longitudinal studies to follow-up women through to later stages of life to better understand their experiences of IPV over the life course. As anticipated, very few women had talked to their doctor about their experiences of IPV, and one in five women had not told anyone, similar to evidence from a community sample.26 More women had spoken to friends or family about IPV during the pandemic compared with earlier waves. This is consistent with other recent research showing that friends and family were the main source of support among women experiencing IPV during the pandemic, as well as in the previous 5 years.26 These findings likely reflect continued contact with friends and family during the pandemic, while there were more significant barriers to accessing health professionals. It is unclear why there are such stark differences between the present study and the recent PSS,28 which showed a decrease in the prevalence of emotional IPV in Victoria, Australia during the pandemic. It is possible that the pressures imposed by the pandemic on parents of adolescents (eg, remote learning and employment, social isolation of parents and adolescents, juggling work and family) may have contributed to higher prevalence of emotional IPV for women with children in this age group. It is unclear what other demographic differences may exist between the studies as this data is not yet available. Differences in data collection processes may have contributed to the disparity. The MYPS used a well-validated measure of IPV across multiple waves of data collection, which involves reporting on a range of behaviours without self-identifying these actions as harmful or violent. Women in the MYPS may have felt more comfortable reporting on IPV due to familiarity with the questions and study processes. In contrast, the PSS is a cross-sectional population-based survey, where participants are interviewed face to face or over the phone (an option added during the pandemic). Some participants may not have felt safe to talk about violence in their home with others more likely to be present compared with earlier administrations of the PSS. Participants in the PSS are also offered to opt out to questions about violence. The subsequent items are repeated for situations including lifetime, recent, partner, familial and stranger experiences of physical or sexual violence and stalking, as well as emotional abuse that caused ‘harm or fear’.28 57 This approach may have influenced prevalence as not all women recognise or name their experiences as violent or describe them as causing harm or fear. Key strengths of our study include recruitment of a community cohort of nulliparous women in early pregnancy and repeated measurement of IPV and mental health outcomes using robust, standardised and well-validated instruments in four waves of data collection over a period of 14–17 years. These longitudinal data for a subsample of 422 women who completed the measure of IPV (CAS) at four time points provided rare evidence of women’s experiences of IPV and mental health prior to and during the pandemic. There are also a number of limitations to note. Due to time constraints and the context of the pandemic, a relatively small proportion of the original cohort participated in the COVID-19 substudy. Compared with the full cohort, the women in our analytic sample were more likely to have completed postsecondary qualifications, to be older and on a higher income at the time of enrolment during early pregnancy. They were also less likely to have experienced IPV or depressive symptoms in the first 12 months after the birth of the index child. These factors are all likely to have biased the prevalence estimates of IPV and mental health problems downwards. Due to the length of the study and time between surveys some women may have experienced IPV outside of the periods of measurement. The small proportion of women reporting physical IPV limited our capacity to compare women experiencing emotional IPV alone with women who were also experiencing physical IPV.\n\nConclusions The relatively high prevalence of emotional IPV, including women reporting IPV for the first time and the low levels of disclosure to health services observed during the pandemic have important implications for policy and practice. There is a clear need for health services to be better equipped to support women exposed to IPV, particularly as many are also experiencing mental health problems.58 59 The majority of women had told friends or family about their experiences of IPV, providing support for a recent recommendation to improve the capacity of informal support networks to respond to IPV disclosure and assist women in connecting with appropriate services and further support.26 Flexible healthcare arrangements established during the pandemic (eg, telehealth) undoubtedly increased access for some women, however more work needs to be done for this to translate into meaningful opportunities for women to access support in relation to IPV. When women present with mental health problems, evidence-based practice for health practitioners would include always considering whether they may be experiencing IPV. There is an urgent need to enhance the capacity of health services to recognise and respond to experiences of IPV, and particularly emotional IPV, which has substantial implications for women’s mental health.\n\nData availability statement Data are available on reasonable request.

        "summary": "STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY Strengths of this study include recruitment of a community cohort of first-time mothers in early pregnancy, the longitudinal design, and repeated measurement of the 12-month period prevalence of physical and emotional intimate partner violence (IPV). A relatively small proportion (n=520, 34.5%) of the original cohort participated in the COVID-19 substudy, and the analytic sample for this study comprised 422 women (28.0%) who completed the measure of IPV at all four time points. Steinhoff et al 38 reported that young men’s use of violence increased over the lockdown period. A COVID-19 substudy was conducted between June 2020 and April 2021 where participants completed surveys through REDCap. 42 43 Patient and public involvement A small pilot group of women provided feedback on draft questionnaires and study procedures prior to study commencement and at each wave of follow-up. Participants are kept informed of study results via a study e-newsletter and a study website. The CAS has demonstrated validity for assessing the prevalence of IPV.44 Recommended scale cut-points were used to identify: physical abuse ≥1 points (eg, ‘threw me’), emotional abuse ≥3 points (eg, ‘blamed me for causing their violent behaviour’, ‘tried to convince my friends, family or children that I was crazy’) and physical and emotional abuse.45 Immediately following the CAS, women were asked ‘Have you told anyone about the above experiences?’. Response options included telling their local doctor/general practitioner, a family member, friend, someone else, or not telling anyone. Relationship status and having a healthcare concession care also were collected in subsequent follow-ups. Results Participants Sample retention from enrolment in early pregnancy to 1-year postpartum was 90.0% (figure 1). Following re-consent, 73.1% women participated at 4 years and 63.2% at 10 years (figure 1). As shown in figure 3, there was a gradual increase in the proportion of women experiencing IPV who reported concurrent depressive symptoms: from 16.3% (95% CI 7.9% to 30.5%) at 1-year postpartum to 22.4% (95% CI 13.5% to 34.9%) at 4-year follow-up, 31.1% (95% CI 20.8% to 43.8%) at 10-year follow-up and 52.7% (95% CI 41.4% to 63.8%) during the pandemic.

        "title": "Prehospital identification of intracerebral haemorrhage: a scoping review of early clinical features and portable devices",
        "text": "Overall, we identified 15 studies that reported early clinical features of ICH among suspected stroke patients and 7 studies that tested portable technologies to detect ICH and other conditions.\n\nEarly clinical features of ICH in suspected stroke patients\n\nDiagnosing ICH based solely on clinical features can be difficult, as many features of ICH overlap with other types of strokes.47 This scoping review has identified potential clinical features that can help distinguish patients with ICH from those with other stroke types or non-stroke diagnoses. The combination of these features might be useful in improving the early prediction of ICH. However, it is important to note that the included studies investigated and reported different clinical features for patients with ICH across various stroke subtypes, and some studies also included TIA and stroke-mimicking conditions in their analyses. In addition, some studies only conducted univariable analysis, and caution is advised when interpreting our results as there could be bias in the studies, such as confounding. Heterogeneity in the definition and categorisation of variables was also observed. Owing to these methodological limitations, we recognise that conducting a meta-analysis of individual features would be highly challenging and unlikely to yield meaningful insights relevant to the aims of this review.\n\nGiven the considerable heterogeneity among the included studies, identifying consistent predictors for the diagnosis of ICH was challenging. In terms of patients’ general information and medical history, neither age nor sex consistently predicted the final diagnosis of ICH across the studies. However, certain factors were reported to be more strongly associated with the presence of ICH, including a history of HTN, prior ICH, haemodialysis, alcohol consumption and the use of warfarin. In contrast, patients with ICH were less frequently found to have a history of AF, CAD, dyslipidaemia, DM, PAD, prior TIA, or IS. If available in the prehospital setting, ECG monitoring can be used to assess the presence of AF, which may help differentiate ICH from IS.26 29 48 49 Nevertheless, the associations between these factors and ICH varied across studies. These results contradict a previous meta-analysis15 that found a greater likelihood of ICH in male patients aged 60 years or less, while a history of TIA, PAD and AF increased the probability of IS being diagnosed.\n\nThe initial signs and symptoms of ICH, such as headache, vomiting and decreased LOC, also demonstrated variability across the included studies. While these manifestations were frequently observed, some studies did not find them to be exclusively indicative of ICH. This discrepancy could potentially be attributed to the inclusion of patients with SAH in certain studies.28 30 Patients with SAH typically present with a sudden onset of headache, vomiting, decreased LOC and neck stiffness.50 51 Consequently, relying solely on these clinical features for the prediction of ICH may lack specificity when compared with patients with SAH.\n\nThe majority of studies in this review consistently reported that patients with ICH experienced more severe neurological deficits at onset compared with other subtypes of stroke, TIA and stroke-mimicking conditions. Furthermore, patients with ICH were less commonly observed to have neurological deficits on awakening when compared with patients who had an IS. These findings are in line with other studies that have reported a higher frequency of hemiplegia/hemiparesis and sensory deficits in patients with cerebral haemorrhage,48 50 while stroke symptoms on awakening were more frequently observed in patients who had an IS.50 52\n\nTo assess and quantify neurological deficits, more than half of the studies used the NIHSS, which consistently showed higher scores in patients with ICH. In fact, a recent study investigating the relationship between early NIHSS scores and ICH volume found that for every 10 mL increase in ICH volume, the NIHSS score increased by 4.5 points.53 However, despite this, the NIHSS is not routinely used by prehospital personnel for stroke assessment due to its complexity and time-consuming nature.54 In an effort to address these limitations, a recent study demonstrated that the NIHSS can be an accurate and time-efficient tool for paramedics in the field,55 suggesting the potential of using the NIHSS items to construct a prehospital prediction model for ICH.29\n\nSeveral prediction models have been proposed to differentiate ICH from other suspected stroke patients in the prehospital setting.25 27–30 These tools can assist prehospital personnel in making accurate and timely decisions for patients who had a stroke. However, their predictive abilities have not been thoroughly studied, compared and evaluated in an independent study. Therefore, further research is necessary to assess their performance, reliability and potential limitations or biases that may impact their effectiveness in real-world settings. The addition of the clinical features found in this review could further improve the performance of these tools.\n\nAnother important finding of this study is that patients with ICH had the highest BP parameters among all suspected stroke patients. Notably, there is a strong correlation between elevated SBP of ≥160 mm Hg and the initial haematoma volume in patients with ICH.56 A post hoc analysis of the FAST-MAG trial revealed a distinct association between SBP and ultra-early neurological deterioration (defined as a deterioration of 2 or more points on the Glasgow Coma Scale within 2 hours of stroke onset) among patients with ICH.57 According to the study, neurological deterioration in patients with ICH was associated with higher SBP on arrival at the ED. Additionally, imaging performed on arrival showed that patients with ICH with neurological deterioration had much larger haematoma volumes, suggesting that early HE may contribute to the deterioration.57 Previous studies have also found an association between prehospital BP values (SBP and DBP) and the occurrence of neurological deterioration in ICH.58 59 These findings partially align with our results, in which there was a very powerful relationship between increased prehospital SBP and the occurrence of ICH among patients who had a stroke with impaired LOC.32",

        "title": "Moral distress measurement in animal care workers: a systematic review",
        "text": "Therefore, in the second step of this study, we considered both PROMs: MMD-HP and MMD-AP for owners of veterinary practices and the employed associates. We chose the MMD-AP version of associates over the practice owners because the associates’ version is the same as the owners’ version but contains three more items. These items are related to superiors’ pressure and their lack of support. Thus, we think this version is more representative of the animal workers’ job experience and covers all items in both the MMD-AP versions. Consequently, we concluded that since no qualitative studies were conducted for item selection of these adapted scales in two different populations, there is no justification for a separate assessment.\n\nIn the COSMIN framework, all revised versions of a PROM are considered as new PROMs and should be assessed independently. As PROMs measure constructs that can only be reported by the patients themselves, no gold standards exist for these measures. 19 In cases when PROM is adapted to be used in another target population than the original target population for which it was developed, a new evaluation is necessary to appraise the relevancy of items in the original PROM. 21 As an example, a PROM that is originally developed for MD in human healthcare professionals may not be relevant for veterinary professionals. Human healthcare and veterinary medicine may experience different moral dilemmas and constraints, and deal with different stakeholders. While an item may reflect MD related to ‘convenience euthanasia’ due to animal owner’s request, an original PROM from human healthcare would not include this potentially relevant item.\n\nNevertheless, despite Giannetta et al’s claim of adhering to COSMIN guidelines in their review, the evaluation of the content validity of existing MD PROMs was not thoroughly executed. Therefore, three reviewers (YB, NG, IGC) took it on themselves to assess the content validity of the PROMs identified in the initial step. This fortuitous discovery within Giannetta et al’s review, however, led us to the original PROM (Measure of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals, MMD-HP), 28 from which our chosen scale, Measure of Moral Distress for Animal Professionals (MMD-AP), 15 was derived. By assessing the original PROM (MMD-HP) along with the adapted version (MMD-AP), we were able to better capture the content of originally selected items and assess their relevance and comprehensiveness with respect to the theoretical foundations of MD construct features.\n\nIn the second step, we evaluated the included studies based on the COSMIN methodology checklist. 21 Following the COSMIN approach, no systematic review on animal healthcare taker was found in the COSMIN database, but an existing systematic review for human healthcare professionals assessed 32 MD scales in their original, revised and translated versions. 18 Our current systematic review and the previous systematic review by Giannetta et al 18 have certain similarities in their research questions, objectives and study design. In both of our research questions/objectives, we tried to identify measures of MD and evaluate them according to COSMIN methodology. Both of the reviews were conducted in a two-step systematic review procedure. In both of the reviews, adaptations of the original studies were identified and evaluated separately.\n\nThe included study was published in 2023 by Kogan and Rishniw 15 and aimed to assess MD in veterinarians, differentiating between the owners of veterinary practices and the employed associates. Kogan and Rishniw found that gender and age were predictors of MD. Indeed, the level of MD was higher in young women than in older men. Moreover, the authors found that a high level of MD was associated with a low level of professional fulfilment and with a high level of exhaustion, burnout and interpersonal disengagement. 15\n\nThe literature search resulted in 560 items. After duplicate removal, 455 records were retained for the first screening based on titles and abstracts. For the second screening based on the full-text screening, we selected 16 articles, from which only one met the inclusion criteria ( figure 1 ). In the other articles, either the MD was not measured (n=13), or it was an ineligible type of publication: such as a dissertation (n=1), or the article did not satisfy the inclusion criteria (n=1), only using the MD prevalence as one of the covariates.\n\nThe second PROM, MMD-AP, resulted from an additional revision of the MMD-HP. Kogan and Rishniw (14) used the MMD-HP 28 to assess MD in veterinarians. The associates’ version, for employed veterinarians, includes 24 items, and the owners’ version has 21 items. The authors explained that they removed items which did not fit the veterinary context. The authors considered the five components at three levels, described by Epstein et al, 28 which were included in the MMD-AP 15 ; these components are complicity in wrongdoing, lack of voice, wrongdoing associated with professional (not personal) values, repeated experiences and three levels of root causes (at patient, unit, system levels). 28 For example, for the root causes system level, one item reads: ‘Experience lack of administrative action or support for a problem that is compromising patient care’. 15 For the patient-level root causes, an item reads: ‘Euthanasia based on client’s unwillingness to treat’. For the team level, there is an item: ‘Feel pressured by superiors to order or carry out orders for what I consider to be unnecessary or inappropriate tests and treatments’. 15 For each item, the response scale is based on the frequency and the distress experienced. Response options and calculation of the MD overall score are the same as the MMD-HP.\n\nThe MMD-HP intends a double scaling, one for the frequency of the described situations and one for the degree of distress each situation results in. Both are scored on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very frequently) for the frequency and from 0 (none) to 4 (very distressing) for the degree of distress. The product of the frequency and the distress scores corresponds to an overall score of MD, ranging from 0 to 432. The higher the score, the greater the level of MD. However, the authors did not mention any cut-off values. 28\n\nThe first identified PROM, MMD-HP, was developed in 2019 by revising the Moral Distress Scale-Revised (MDS-R). 29 Epstein et al revised MDS-R to make it applicable to all health workers. MDS-R itself originally stems from the Moral Distress Scale (MDS). 30 Epstein et al underwent the construction of a new PROM to amend the drawbacks of the original and previous revised versions, namely to simplify the use and to better integrate the causal levels of MD, more specifically the team and system levels. Epstein et al reviewed the literature over the past 5 years to identify new roots of causes of MD. The new elements led to the deletion of three items, the modification of three other items, the consolidation of two items and the addition of 11 new items. The new items integrated the team and system levels, which, according to Epstein et al, were a weakness of MDS-R, mostly focused on the patient level. The MMD-HP contains 27 items and the three levels of roots to separate the items into four factors. Some items appear in more than one factor. The first factor corresponds to the primarily system level, while the second factor corresponds to the clinical level at the patient level. Factors 3 and 4 both represent the team level. However, factor 3 contains items, which imply a threat to personal integrity from a member of his team, whereas factor 4 concerns the team’s communication with patients and families.\n\nThe two identified PROMs share the same construct of MD, initially defined by Jameton. 13 Epstein et al 28 defined it later as follows: ‘The pressure to act unethically is the defining concept of the phenomenon and it separates those situations that are emotionally distressing or otherwise morally troubling from those that threaten moral integrity’. Epstein et al 28 considered five important factors as causes of MD that inspired the MMD-HP structure: complicity in wrongdoing, lack of voice, professional values, the repetitive nature of MD and the three roots of causes. These three roots were ordered at three different levels: patients or their families, for example, when the family asks for a treatment that does more harm to the patient than good. The colleagues or the team can be a cause of MD, for example, in the case of poor communication between team members. Finally, the system can cause MD when there is a lack of human, material or financial resources. MD can be a combination of stressors arising at these three levels. For instance, if the worker faces pressure situations in which he/she cannot report an error committed by a colleague frequently, his/her opinion cannot be considered and his/her professional ethic could be violated. 28\n\nQuality of psychometric validity of the selected PROMs\n\nQuality of the PROM development The COSMIN guidelines for evaluating the quality of the study on the PROM development consist of two parts. The first part deals with the standards used to assess the quality of the searches carried out to find the most suitable items for the new PROM. It includes general design requirements and concept elicitation. The concept of elicitation is important for relevance and comprehensiveness of the PROM. The second part looks at the standards used to assess the quality of the cognitive interview study or pilot studies conducted. The aim is to rate the comprehensiveness and comprehensibility of the PROM.20 For both PROMs, the construct and its origin, the target population and the context of use were well defined and rated as very good. Both PROMs have been developed in English and tested in a sample representing the target population, thus the general design requirements were also rated as very good. We appraised the concept elicitation as doubtful for MMD-AP and adequate for MMD-HP. For these two PROMs, we could not rate them as very good, because the qualitative data collection was not or not enough described, even after contacting the authors for further information on the analyses they carried out. The total PROM design was thus rated as adequate for MMD-HP and doubtful for MMD-AP. The MMD-AP authors conducted a very good cognitive interview asking the target population (ie, veterinarians) for guidance and feedback, thus we evaluated the general design requirements as very good. For MMD-HP, the rating was adequate because the cognitive interview was performed with experts and clinicians but not with all health professionals. However, Kogan and Rishniw did not ask the participants about the comprehensibility of the items included in the PROM. Comprehensibility is the standard that ensures that PROM is comprehensible to the target population. For a very good rating, different PROM components need to be evaluated separately: instruction, item, response option and recall period.20 Since the authors did not mention whether they have evaluated these components for MMD-AP, we rated the quality of the comprehensibility study as doubtful. Finally, the total quality of the MMD-AP development study was rated as doubtful. For MMD-HP, the comprehensibility was also assessed as doubtful. Although its authors carried out a study to evaluate the face validity, they did not mention whether they used an interview guide and did verbatim transcriptions. Table 1 summarises the results of the PROM development assessment, with the items considered and their consensual rating by two independent reviewers. Table 1 Quality of the PROM development\n\nQuality of the PROM content validity The criteria to assess content validity are relevance, comprehensiveness and comprehensibility. The relevance means, for example, ensuring that PROM items are adapted to the target population and to the context in which they are used. The comprehensiveness evaluates the completeness of the PROM and the comprehensibility concerns the understanding of the PROM by the target population. Table 2 summarises the results of these three criteria for PROM content validity assessment. Table 2 Systematic results for the MMD-HP and MMD-AP PROMs for the criteria content validity Quality of evidence for MD scales is assessed using the modified GRADE approach for risk of bias.19 23 This approach allows reviewers to adjust their evaluations of pooled results of PROM measurement property evaluations. It assumes that pooled results of individual measurement properties have an overestimation of the quality of evidence; thus, they have to be downgraded, given suspicion over trustworthiness of the published results. It consists of five factors to determine the quality of the evidence: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias. Within these factors, three of these factors are applicable to content validity evaluation: risk of bias, inconsistency and indirectness.19 20 The risk of bias depends on the number of publications available in the literature on a given PROM, from its development to numerous studies evaluating its measurement properties, and the evaluators’ judgements based on their appropriateness. For example, the indirectness factor is related to whether qualitative methods are carried out on a representative sample of the intended target population. The inconsistency factor depends on the variability of ratings given to each item by reviewers based on the COSMIN content validity methodology checklist. If there is no explanation found to explain the variability of ratings, the rating is downgraded to ‘inconsistent’.19 Table 3 summarises the results of the PROMs overall rating of content validity, with the adjusted quality of evidence. Table 3 Systematic results for the overall rating of MMD-HP and MMD-AP PROMs and their quality of evidence For the MMD-AP content validity assessment, the development study was evaluated as inconsistent. The lack of information on qualitative data collection for the development of this PROM led to an insufficient assessment of the relevance. For comprehensiveness, the key concepts were missing, and we rated it as insufficient. The comprehensibility was also rated as insufficient because the authors did not report whether they tested or not the understanding of the PROM. Both reviewers rated the development study of this PROM as sufficient. The reviewers estimated that the PROM itself contained the necessary information. Consequently, the overall rating of the MMD-AP was inconsistent. There was no content validity study available for this PROM.15 Therefore, the lack of studies on content validity and the doubtful PROM development study has resulted in a low quality of evidence. The content validity of MMD-HP was rated as sufficient. Indeed, the relevance, comprehensiveness and comprehensibility were rated as sufficient, and the two reviewers also evaluated these properties as sufficient. Overall, the content validity rating was also sufficient. Since we did not find any content validity study for MMD-HP, the quality of evidence grading started as moderate. Then, we downgraded it to low because the PROM’s development study has been assessed as doubtful.",
        "summary": "Therefore, in the second step of this study, we considered both PROMs: MMD-HP and MMD-AP for owners of veterinary practices and the employed associates. Thus, we think this version is more representative of the animal workers’ job experience and covers all items in both the MMD-AP versions. In the COSMIN framework, all revised versions of a PROM are considered as new PROMs and should be assessed independently. Nevertheless, despite Giannetta et al’s claim of adhering to COSMIN guidelines in their review, the evaluation of the content validity of existing MD PROMs was not thoroughly executed. Both of the reviews were conducted in a two-step systematic review procedure. Indeed, the level of MD was higher in young women than in older men. 15\n\nThe literature search resulted in 560 items. After duplicate removal, 455 records were retained for the first screening based on titles and abstracts. 28 For example, for the root causes system level, one item reads: ‘Experience lack of administrative action or support for a problem that is compromising patient care’. 15 For each item, the response scale is based on the frequency and the distress experienced. Both are scored on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very frequently) for the frequency and from 0 (none) to 4 (very distressing) for the degree of distress. The higher the score, the greater the level of MD. 29 Epstein et al revised MDS-R to make it applicable to all health workers. Epstein et al 28 considered five important factors as causes of MD that inspired the MMD-HP structure: complicity in wrongdoing, lack of voice, professional values, the repetitive nature of MD and the three roots of causes. MD can be a combination of stressors arising at these three levels. 28\n\nQuality of psychometric validity of the selected PROMs\n\nQuality of the PROM development The COSMIN guidelines for evaluating the quality of the study on the PROM development consist of two parts. For MMD-HP, the rating was adequate because the cognitive interview was performed with experts and clinicians but not with all health professionals. For a very good rating, different PROM components need to be evaluated separately: instruction, item, response option and recall period.20 Since the authors did not mention whether they have evaluated these components for MMD-AP, we rated the quality of the comprehensibility study as doubtful. The comprehensiveness evaluates the completeness of the PROM and the comprehensibility concerns the understanding of the PROM by the target population. Both reviewers rated the development study of this PROM as sufficient. The reviewers estimated that the PROM itself contained the necessary information. Since we did not find any content validity study for MMD-HP, the quality of evidence grading started as moderate."

        "title": "Art therapies and cognitive function in elderly with subjective cognitive decline: a protocol for a network meta-analysis",
        "text": "Introduction\n\nAs a global public health problem that urgently needs to be addressed, dementia leads to the loss of reasoning, memory, language and ultimately basic self-care skills, which places an enormous burden on families and the healthcare system. The development of dementia, such as Alzheimer’s disease, is insidious, with onset of clinical symptoms preceded years earlier by perceived and/or objective cognitive decline,1 which is also the early stage of mild cognitive impairment.2 Subjective cognitive decline refers to the decline in the subjective perception of self-cognitive function compared with the previous normal state, mainly memory decline, but objective neuropsychological tests are not abnormal, and this decline is not related to other acute events.3 Previous studies have suggested that subjective cognitive decline is a preclinical symptom of mild cognitive impairment and dementia.4–7 The risk of developing dementia in the elderly with subjective cognitive decline was 2.48 times higher than that in the elderly without cognitive abnormalities, and the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment was 1.83 times higher than that in the elderly without cognitive abnormalities.7 Moreover, the findings of a long-term observational study over 10 years indicate that subjective cognitive decline can occur 10 years before the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.8 Therefore, the therapeutic window for addressing Alzheimer’s disease can be moved forward, and subjective cognitive decline can be regarded as an important gateway for early prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, which may help alleviate the major public health problem, although there are no approved treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and even mild cognitive impairment.9\n\nThe efficacy of pharmacological interventions is limited. To avoid the side effects of antipsychotics, more attention is given to the application of non-pharmacological interventions.10 Art therapy is an emerging non-pharmacological intervention with distinctive features that integrates psychology, art and medicine. Art therapy can take a variety of forms, such as music, singing, dancing, reading and poetry groups, museum/gallery art and collections, creative writing, life story narrative reminiscence, painting, printmaking, collage, pottery, sewing, knitting, woodwork and gardening.11 As a kind of non-pharmacological intervention, art therapy has been widely proven to be beneficial in the care of patients with cognitive impairment and has been used in clinical practice in Europe and the USA.12 It is helpful to reduce the mental and behavioural abnormalities of patients and slow down the progress of cognitive impairment, to achieve great effects in treatment and care. It is suggested that music listening can help to improve both subjective memory function and objective cognitive performance in adults with subjective cognitive decline.13 Several randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that dance therapy can improve cognitive function, especially episodic memory and processing speed.14–16 Moreover, painting therapy has been proven to improve cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment.17 A narrow review has summarised the positive effects of therapeutic gardens on the health, spanning physical, social, psychological and cognitive effects.18 Additionally, spiritual reminiscence programmes using expressive arts therapy are conducive to improving cognitive function.19\n\nWith the increase in relevant research, art therapy has gradually been proven to be of great significance in alleviating cognitive decline. However, the advantages and disadvantages of the effects of different art therapies on elderly with subjective cognitive decline are still inconclusive at present, and studies directly comparing the differences in various art therapies are lacking. Network meta-analysis is capable of summarising direct and indirect evidence, thus evaluating and comparing the relative efficacy of multiple treatments.20 More importantly, network meta-analysis can provide the ranking of intervention options in accordance with their effectiveness. Therefore, this study will evaluate the effects of different art therapies on cognitive function in elderly (aged 60 and above) with subjective cognitive decline through a network meta-analysis, with the aim of identifying the most effective art therapy for this patient group. These findings may provide important evidence for care decision-making in elderly with subjective cognitive decline.",

        "title": "Association between leucocyte telomere length and erectile dysfunction in US adults: a secondary study based on 2001–2002 NHANES data",
        "text": "Previous studies have noted the role of the LTL in a range of diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction. Codd et al 14 found a huge association between diabetes and the LTL in the largest LTL study thus far, and a Mendelian randomisation analysis indicated that reductions in LTL per unit were associated with a 1.38-fold higher risk of diabetes progression in patients with type 2 diabetes. 15 In addition, the negative relationship between the LTL and diseases associated with vascular endothelial disorders has been demonstrated in studies of CVD, hyperlipidaemia and stroke. 16–18 These findings collectively suggest a possible association between ED and the LTL. However, the relationship between LTL and ED has not been clearly established.\n\nTelomeres consist of repetitive sequence nucleotides and a protein complex located at the ends of chromosomes and are important for stabilising and preventing chromosome degeneration. 10 Telomeres naturally shorten as cells divide. However, telomerase fills telomeres lost by DNA replication and lengthens and repairs telomeres so that telomeres are not depleted by cell division. 11 Differentiated human cells generally lack telomerase activity, so cells are unable to replicate a small fraction of telomeres. 12 This is why telomeres have been described as biological markers of cellular senescence. Oxidative stress and inflammatory factors have been demonstrated to further contribute to telomere attrition. 13 The leucocyte telomere length (LTL) has also been shown to be inversely associated with inflammation-related chronic diseases.\n\nInadequate penile erection or inability to maintain erectile status to complete satisfactory sexual behaviour is defined as erectile dysfunction (ED) and the degree of erection can be classified as no ED, mild, moderate and severe based on the hardness of erection. 1 About 150 million men around the world are afflicted with varying degrees of ED, 2 and a previous epidemiological study conducted in eight countries reported that the ED prevalence in middle-aged and elderly males was approximately 50%. 3 There is a growing concern about the rising prevalence of ED among young men, with estimates suggesting that it may affect up to 30% of this population. 4 ED places a significant psychological and financial burden on affected individuals. Moreover, diseases within this highly affected population can also impose a burden on society as a whole. Thus, it is critical to develop suitable biomarkers for early diagnosis and intervention for ED and to identify previously unexplored risk factors such as the COVID-19. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with an elevated prevalence of ED. 5\n\nWe addressed a few missing values for model covariates using the missForest package in R software. 25 The algorithm can handle categorical and continuous variables and has demonstrated robust performance, with the number and percentage of missing covariate data shown in online supplemental table 1 . Sensitivity analyses excluded missing covariate data to assess the impact on attribution methods, and data from the analyses are presented in online supplemental tables 2 and 3 . In addition, we presented the results again using the quartile of telomere length (Q3) where the inflection point was located as a reference, and the result was added to online supplemental table 4 .\n\nWe used appropriate sample weights to recover population-level data across the US for statistical analysis according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analysis guidelines. 25 The LTL was classified into quartiles based on the weighted sample distribution. Continuous variables are presented as the weighted mean±SD and were compared using the one-way analysis of variance. Categorical variables are presented as weighted percentages (95% CI) and were compared using the Rao-Scott χ 2 test. In addition, we used weighted logistic regression models to estimate ORs and CIs between LTL quartiles and ED. Multivariate models included model 1 (without any adjustment), model 2 (adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, education level, smoking status, PIR, vigorous activity, moderate activity, alcohol consumption status) and model 3 (adjusted for model 2 plus hypertension, diabetes, CVD, CKD, hyperlipidaemia and ED medications). Subgroup analysis was conducted using stratified multivariate logistic regression analysis and stratified by age, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, CVD, CKD, hyperlipidaemia. Multiplicative interactions between subgroups were assessed using likelihood ratio tests, which assess the heterogeneity of associations between subgroups. Moreover, non-linear relationships between the LTL and ED were explored at restricted cubic splines with 3 knots at the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles in fully adjusted models. If non-linearity was detected, we constructed a two-piece logistic regression model to calculate the threshold effect of the LTL on ED.\n\nInformation on covariates was collected as per the NHANES examinations and questionnaires administered by highly trained medical personnel. Participants reported the following information: demographic characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, education level, poverty income ratio (PIR)), lifestyle (body mass index(BMI), smoking status, alcohol consumption status, vigorous activity and moderate activity) and medical history (hypertension, diabetes, CVD, chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyperlipidaemia and ED medications). In the 2001–2002 NHANES cycles, race/ethnicity was grouped into five categories based on race and Hispanic origin. Income levels were divided into three categories (< 1.3, 1.3–1.8 and>1.8) based on PIRs. In addition, BMI was calculated as weight divided by the square of height and divided into two groups according to ≥30 and <30. Participants were divided into former smokers, never smokers and current smokers according to the number of cigarettes smoked during their lifetime and current smoking status. Alcohol consumption status was categorised as yes or no based on at least 12 drinks per year. Moderate or vigorous activity was based on the participant’s exercise during the past 30 days. Hypertension was defined as a mean systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥80 mm or the use of hypertension medication or diagnosis by a physician or other healthcare professional. 21 Random blood glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L, Hemoglobin A1c>6.5% or using diabetes pills or insulin were defined as having diabetes mellitus, as diagnosed by a physician or other professional. 22 CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min 1.73 m 2 or an albumin creatinine ratio>30 mg/g. 23 Triglycerides≥150 mg/dL, Low-density lipoprotein≥130 mg/dL, High-density lipoprotein<40 mg/dL and the use of lipid-lowering agents were defined as hyperlipidaemia. 24 ED medications were defined as having taken any medication for ED (including sildenafil citrate and yohimbine)\n\nBlood samples from all surveyed individuals were collected as part of the NHANES. The telomere length assay was performed in the laboratory of Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn at the University of California, San Francisco, and PCR was used to measure the telomere length relative to the length of standard reference DNA (T/S ratio). Each blood sample was assayed three times on three different days. Assay runs included control values beyond two SDs of the mean of all runs (<6% of runs). Outliers within samples were identified and excluded (<2% of samples). A detailed description of the LTL quantification procedure and analytical methods can be found on the official website ( http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm ).\n\nThe Massachusetts Male Aging Study single-question self-assessment for evaluation of ED was used. 20 The participants were provided the following information and asked the following question: ‘Many men experience problems with sexual intercourse. How would you describe your ability to get and keep an erection adequate for satisfactory intercourse?’ The answer options were as follows: ‘never able’, ‘sometimes able’, ‘usually, able’ and ‘always or almost always able’. Participants who responded ‘sometimes able’ or ‘never able’ were defined as having ED. Participants who provided the latter two responses were defined as not having ED.\n\nThis study represents our analysis of participants from the 2001 to 2002 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) because only this cycle contained LTL ( https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2001-2002/TELO_B.htm .) and ED ( https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2001-2002/KIQ_P_B.htm ) information. NHANES uses a stratified, multistage, clustered probability sampling design, which allows it to be a sample that fits the stratification of the US population. In addition, this study was designed according to the guidelines for reporting cross-sectional studies as specified in the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. 19\n\nOur study imputed missing covariates using the missForest package (all variables were below 5.00% except for PIR, which had 5.25% missing data). MissForest had a seed number of 500, and data imputation was completed after six iterations. The calculated normalised root mean square error of the imputation model evaluation index was 0.0001, and the proportion of falsely classified was 0.081. The ‘grubbs.test()’ function function is employed to determine the presence of outliers. Our sensitivity analysis results showed that the results remained similar after removing subjects with missing data and it was determined that the findings of all models remained consistent and the overall study was not influenced by the presence of outliers ( online supplemental tables 2,3,6 ). The ( online supplemental table 4 ) displays the multivariable logistic regression analysis of the association between LTL and ED, using Q3 as the reference category.\n\nWe performed subgroup analyses to assess whether the association between the LTL and ED was influenced by age, obesity level or chronic non-communicable disease ( figure 2 ). The results showed that the interaction test was not statistically significant for age, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, CVD, CKD or hyperlipidaemia after adjusting for all potential confounders (p>0.05). The subgroup analysis results were consistent with the overall results, which indicated that there were no systematic differences in the associations between subpopulations. Thus, our main results were stable.\n\nThe restricted cubic spline plot displayed an inverted J-curve association between the LTL and the prevalence of ED (p for non-linearity=0.011) ( figure 1 ). We further performed a threshold effect analysis of the association between the LTL and the prevalence of ED ( table 3 ). We fit a logistic regression model and a two-piece logistic regression model to test the relationship between the LTL and ED. The results showed that the two-piece logistic regression model was superior to the logistic regression model for the association between the LTL and ED (p for the log likelihood ratio test <0.001). We identified an inflection point of 1.037 for the LTL. When the LTL was less than 1.037, there was no statistically significant association between LTL as a continuous variable and ED in the logistic regression model.\n\nTable 2 presents the association of the LTL and ED based on multivariate logistic regression. The association between the LTL as a continuous covariate and ED was negative in the unadjusted model (OR 0.12; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.22; p<0.0001). In analyses where the LTL was included as a quartile, this association did not change as the telomere length increased (p for trend <0.0001). However, this association was no longer significant in models adjusted for multiple covariates.\n\nThe mean age of the population surveyed was 43.56±0.59 years, and the mean LTL was 1.08±0.02. Among the participants, 73.92% (65.78–82.07) were non-Hispanic white, and 56.02% (50.28–61.76) had an above high school education. The average LTL was shorter in the ED participants than in the non-ED participants (0.97±0.02 vs 1.09±0.02, p<0.0001). In contrast, compared with the non-ED participants, the ED participants were on average older (58.32±1.00 vs 40.83±0.45, p<0.0001). In addition, compared with the shorter LTL groups (Q1 and Q2), the longer LTL groups (Q3 and Q4) were associated with younger age and more vigorous physical activity. In contrast, the shorter LTL groups had a higher prevalence of hypertension, CVD, CKD and hyperlipidaemia (all p<0.001). Notably, subjects with ED had a higher prevalence of non-communicable diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, CVD, CKD and hyperlipidaemia.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn a previous meta-analysis comprising 23 observational studies, it was observed that both sperm and LTL were notably shorter in infertile individuals compared with fertile individuals. The mean differences (95% CI) were −1.43 (−1.66 to −1.21) with a p<0.001 for sperm telomere length, and −1.67 (−2.02 to −1.31) with a p<0.001 for LTL. Moreover, significant differences in telomere length (−0.97 (−1.32 to –0.61), p<0.001) were also observed between spermatozoa from normal individuals and those with low sperm counts in semen.26 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the associations between the LTL and ED. A nationally representative dataset of US men was used to examine the relationship between the LTL and ED through epidemiological studies. However, although we observed that people with ED possess shorter telomeres, instead of obtaining a linear correlation, our findings suggested an inverted J-curve relationship between the LTL and ED. When the LTL was ≥1.037, the LTL was inversely associated with ED. Moreover, people in the second and third LTL quartiles had a higher chance of developing ED than those in the first LTL quartile.\n\nOur initial hypothesis posits that longer telomere lengths are correlated with a lower prevalence of ED. This hypothesis was validated through the analysis presented in table 1, which demonstrates an increasing trend of ED prevalence with increasing telomere length. Additionally, the unadjusted models provided further support for this relationship, with a reported OR of 0.12 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.22) when considering population characteristics. Nevertheless, the relationship between age and telomere length has been consistently established in prior studies. Therefore, when age was accounted for as a covariate and LTL was treated as a continuous variable in the logistic regression model, this previously observed association disappeared. This led us to speculate that the relationship between LTL and ED may transition from an initial linear association to a non-linear one under the influence of age. In the analysis considering LTL as a grouping variable, we observed statistically significant results only for Q2 and Q3, with Q1 as the reference category. To enhance our understanding of the association between LTL and ED while accounting for potential confounding factors, we conducted further analysis using non-linear regression models, specifically restricted cubic splines. The results of the RCS analysis revealed an inverted J-shaped relationship between LTL and ED, with an inflection point estimated at 1.037. To further explore this association, we performed logistic regression using LTL as a continuous variable on either side of the inflection point. The findings indicated a linear negative correlation between LTL and ED (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.90) specifically on the right side of the inflection point (LTL values greater than 1.037). On the left side of the inflection point, there may be a potential risk factor for ED in terms of increasing LTL (OR 1.99). However, it is important to note that this association, while present, did not reach statistical significance in the logistic regression model. This suggests that the relationship between LTL on the left side of the inflection point and ED is not linear in nature.\n\nThe LTL is inversely associated with ED once the threshold is exceeded. This may be due to the complex aetiology of ED. In addition to vascular endothelial dysfunction, psychological factors, neural signal transmission and hormonal factors are also potential causes of ED.27 The association between the LTL and ED is a result of multiple factors. Several possible mechanisms may support the observed relationship between the LTL and ED. First, because DNA replication at chromosome ends is incomplete, telomeres shorten at every cell division, and oxidative stress and inflammatory factors have been demonstrated to further contribute to telomere attrition.12 During sexual or tactile stimulation, the cavernous nerve releases nitric oxide (NO), which stimulates the formation of cyclic GMP, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and promoting erection.28 Abnormalities in the NO/cGMP pathway resulting from oxidative stress and inflammation, including decreased NO synthase (NOS) activity and diminished NO bioavailability, may contribute to the development of ED.29 This explains why the mean LTL of ED patients in our study was shorter than that of the control population and was inversely associated with ED. In contrast, testosterone (T), an important hormone regulating the process of penile erection and maintaining erectile status, may accelerate telomere attrition in men by increasing sensitivity to oxidative stress.30 31 T can not only upregulate the expression of NOS but also downregulate RhoA-ROCK pathway activity, which is involved in regulating penile smooth muscle relaxation for a long time.32 33 Thus, in our study, compared with the normal population, some ED patients may have a longer LTL due to lack of T.\n\nIn addition, psychological factors are thought to coexist in almost all ED patients34 and have the potential to influence the association of the LTL with ED. A causal relationship between psychiatric disorders and ED remains undetermined. The results of a meta-analysis by Atlantis and Sullivan suggested a bidirectional association between depression and ED in men aged 18 years and older.35 A recent large retrospective study further confirmed this association in more than 30 000 ED samples. Stigmatisation of sexual failure and cultural shifts in male self-images are the main explanations for this association.36 However, we believe that the telomere length also deserves consideration. Studies have shown that people with depression and those living under social stress have shorter LTL.37 38 LTL has also been suggested to be inversely associated with the duration and severity of severe affective episodes.39 The ED patients in our study may have been chronically exposed to anxiety and depressed mood resulting from sexual failure, which may have accelerated their telomere attrition. Moreover, classical antidepressant drugs, represented by dopamine D2 receptor blockers, have the side effect of causing ED.40 An in vitro study using hippocampal cell lines showed that these antidepressants increase the expression of components of shelterin, TRF1 and TRF2, thereby decreasing damage to telomeres.41 This suggests that the effects of a depressive state and antidepressant medication use on the LTL in people with ED may be paradoxical.\n\nRemarkably, recent Mendelian randomisation studies and prospective studies have indicated that a longer LTL is associated with a higher risk of some cancers, including prostate cancer.42–44 The development and progression of ED is directly and indirectly influenced by a variety of cancers, particularly prostate cancer. Radical prostatectomy and prostate radiation therapy can cause ED,45 46 and ED is a potential cause of prostate cancer.47 Although we excluded prostate cancer patients from our study, it is not clear whether the telomere length in some ED patients is altered by the development of cancer. Moreover, the impact of other prostate diseases on the interaction between the LTL and ED deserves consideration. Lower urinary tract symptoms and benign prostatic hyperplasia are also highly associated with the development of ED.48 However, previous studies have found no difference in the LTL between benign prostatic hyperplasia and the normal population, suggesting that benign prostatic hyperplasia has a small impact on our findings.49\n\nInterestingly, our study is not the first to find a particular relationship between the LTL and disease. In a German study50 of 4802 patients with CKD, the LTL had a U-shaped association with CKD duration. The LTL was significantly longer in patients with a CKD duration of less than 6 months or more than 5 years compared with patients with a moderate CKD duration. Similar to our hypothesis, these researchers suggested that this is a result of inflammation and oxidative stress combined with other factors. They proposed that long-term inflammatory effects may extend the telomere length by increasing telomerase activity. However, limited by the study design, we could not verify this possibility. In addition, U-shaped curves have also been widely identified in cancer-related studies, including gastric adenocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer and glioma. Current mainstream explanations are that telomeres that are too short lead to chromosomal instability causing carcinogenesis and long telomeres upregulate cell division and increase the possibility of abnormalities causing carcinogenesis.51–53\n\nNevertheless, our study has several limitations. First, because of the limitations of the NHANES database, our secondary study could not detect a causal relationship between the LTL and ED. In addition, there were missing values in covariates, to address these missing values, we imputed the missing covariates using the missForest package in the R software. Second, the diagnosis of ED was based on questionnaires and lacks specialised diagnostic tests, which may lead to selection bias. However, the validity of single-question self-report for ED in the NHANES database has been validated previously.54 55 Third, limited by the data, the range of the fourth LTL quartile was large, and the distribution of participants was discrete, which may affect the construction of our non-linear model. Last, despite our extensive adjustment for major confounders, we cannot completely rule out residual or non-existent confounding in the database, particularly prostate-related diseases and information on the use of drugs for ED. Thus, the results from large longitudinal studies would be the best evidence to evaluate the effect of the relationship between the LTL and ED.",

Lower urinary tract symptoms and benign prostatic hyperplasia are also highly associated with the development of ED.48 However, previous studies have found no difference in the LTL between benign prostatic hyperplasia and the normal population, suggesting that benign prostatic hyperplasia has a small impact on our findings.49\n\nInterestingly, our study is not the first to find a particular relationship between the LTL and disease. However, the validity of single-question self-report for ED in the NHANES database has been validated previously.54 55 Third, limited by the data, the range of the fourth LTL quartile was large, and the distribution of participants was discrete, which may affect the construction of our non-linear model."

        "title": "Effectiveness of an online recovery training for employees exposed to blurred boundaries between work and non-work: Bayesian analysis of a randomised controlled trial",
        "text": "We evaluated the digital intervention ‘GET.ON Recovery’, which specifically targets employees exposed to blurred work and non-work boundaries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first intervention to combine digital CBT-I and methods that focus on mental detachment from work-related problems, thereby promoting work-personal life separation and active recovery behaviours to foster better sleep. We hypothesised that GET.ON Recovery would lead to greater reductions in insomnia symptoms both right after the intervention and at 6-month follow-up relative to a waitlist control (WLC) condition that had full access to care as usual.\n\nAs such, it seems worthwhile to develop and evaluate interventions that address the interplay between low segmentation supplies, lack of mental detachment, the presence of work-related rumination and poor sleep. In general, strong evidence for positive effects on sleep has been found in a meta-analysis assessing cognitive–behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) delivered digitally in mostly clinical samples. 15 Nonetheless, to date, no evidence has been published to suggest that mental detachment and sleep can be improved in employees working in a low-segmentation-supply environment, using a digital intervention.\n\nWith major changes in work life over the last decade providing advantages like greater flexibility and autonomy for employees, the disadvantages of this development have also become more salient: Extended availability, thereby exposing employees to blurred boundaries between work and non-work, can negatively affect health-related outcomes; for example, through emotional exhaustion and poor sleep. 6 Depending on formal and informal policies, workplaces differ to the extent that they ‘supply’ the conditions and resources that enable a certain level of work-home segregation or integration 7 : According to Kreiner, workplaces with low segmentation supplies are characterised by workers being required to engage in professional issues outside of actual working hours. Apart from the supplies, preferences for segmentation or integration of work and non-work can also vary between individuals. 8 Meanwhile, those working under low segmentation supply conditions report reduced mental detachment from work, irrespective of their personal preferences. 9 This adverse effect seems best explained by the constant mental representation of work-related stressors and continued involvement with work-related content, also known as ‘rumination’. 10 In particular, work-related rumination is associated with prolonged physiological activation and high arousal, thereby making it difficult for employees to fall and remain asleep. 11 To prevent employees from developing or maintaining insomnia, it seems vital to develop skills that reduce work-related rumination, especially for those working in risky environments characterised by low segmentation supplies. Detachment, defined as an ‘individual’s sense of being away from the work situation’, 12 is considered vital for recovery from work-related stressors. 13 While work-related rumination refers to the presence of arousing and sleep-inhibiting thoughts, mental detachment refers to their absence. In a recent meta-analysis by Karabinski et al, 14 several interventions were shown to reduce work-related rumination and increase mental detachment from work to almost the same extent. While no gold standard intervention for improving mental detachment was identifiable, several approaches seem to be effective; especially those that focus on combining mental detachment and sleep.\n\nSleep problems have emerged as a substantial concern, impacting roughly 30% of the global population in Western industrialised regions, with insomnia affecting approximately 10%. 1 The prevalence of subclinical insomnia varies in the working population, ranging from 7% to 37% across different European countries. 2 Evidence from meta-analyses shows the negative effects of impaired sleep on overall work performance, including counterproductive work behaviour and suboptimal task performance. 3 Also, the workplace itself can significantly influence sleep quality and quantity, with factors like shift work, high job demands, effort-reward imbalance and job strain all contributing. 4 Impaired sleep, in turn, is known to be a risk factor for a variety of mental and physical disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, cardiovascular disease and stroke. 5\n\nFor sensitivity analysis, we used Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow as a prior and performed both a Bayesian and classical analysis of covariance to assess for between-group differences at T2 and T3 with the insomnia score at baseline as a covariate and also performed these analyses with the study-completer sample. For all analyses, ANCOVAs were performed with baseline scores as a covariate to control for potential baseline imbalances. All reported p values are two-sided with a significance level of 0.05. For both Bayesian and classical statistics, data analysis was performed using JASP V.0.14.1.0. We addressed missing data using multiple imputations, generating 10 estimates for each missing value.\n\nAlthough the potential benefits of incorporating prior knowledge into Bayesian analysis are widely recognised, its practical realisation is often criticised. In particular, the estimation of prior knowledge is often criticised as weak, arbitrary and uninformed. 31 To overcome this serious limitation, in our Bayesian analysis, we were able to use the results of three trials of the same intervention as an informed prior. 19–21 To test our hypothesis, the Bayes factor (BF) was used to quantify the evidence for the different tested models. 32 BFs are expressed in terms of the relative strength of evidence when comparing two hypotheses, given the data and prior expectations about the parameters. When dealing with the concepts of the null hypothesis (ie, the parameter value is indeed 0) and a broad alternative hypothesis (ie, the parameter value differs from 0), the BF quantifies the relative evidence for or against these hypotheses, by presenting it as a ratio, akin to odds: For instance, if the statistical evidence strongly supports the alternative hypothesis, say 100 times more than the null, it is denoted as BF 10 =100. The ‘ 10 ’ in the index shows that the evidence is calculated by dividing the probability of the alternative hypothesis (‘1’) by that of the null hypothesis (‘0’), hence 100/1=100. Additionally, if one can appropriately define prior expectations about different hypotheses, the posterior odds can be specified. These odds, like BFs, are ratios, calculated by multiplying the BF with the hypothesis’s prior probability. 32 For reporting Bayesian estimation, we adhered to the guidelines published by the American Psychological Association. 33\n\nData were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Bayesian analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to assess the intervention’s effectiveness. Over the past few years, Bayesian inference has grown in popularity, with Bayesian methods being used more frequently in health sciences. 30 Despite the numerous advantages attributed to Bayesian inference, it often plays a subordinate role in analysing mental health interventions, particularly in RCT evaluations. Notable advantages of the Bayesian approach involve the opportunity of systematically incorporating prior knowledge into the analysis, and quantifying the strength of evidence in favour of a hypothesis.\n\nThe primary outcome was insomnia severity, measured using the German version of the ISI. 18 This scale contains seven items, each answered on a 5-point scale (eg, ‘How satisfied/dissatisfied are you with your current sleep pattern?’, rated 0–4) with a total score ranging from 0 to 28. To detect a meaningful improvement or deterioration in insomnia severity from T1 to T2 and from T1 to T3, proposed change scores extracted from a study by Morin et al 22 were used; they considered an ISI score difference >4.6 points as a slight improvement in symptoms. The number needed to treat (NNT) was then calculated by comparing the two study groups. Symptom-free status also was assessed, corresponding to a score <8.\n\nTraining consisted of six modules, each averaging 45–60 min, which were completed independently by participants, though one module per week was recommended. The modules were based on iCBT-I (Internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia) with a special focus on detachment, incorporating elements like psychoeducation about sleep and recovery, sleep hygiene, sleep restriction, relaxation and stimulus control, as well as boundary tactics to support mental detachment and cognitive methods to reduce hyperarousal. A detailed list of exercises promoting detachment and coping with low segmentation is available in the appendix ( online supplemental table S1 ). The intervention group was provided with adherence-focused support, which means participants were supported in the completion of the intervention module by being sent email reminders and could ask for support from a trained coach after each completed module; though doing so was unnecessary for them to proceed to the next one.\n\nThe recovery training had already been tested in previous studies with school teachers 19 20 who were considered to experience blurred boundaries between work and non-work. However, in both these studies, low segmentation supplies were not measured empirically, which was an important limitation. The teacher-specific version was adapted to the general working population by changing the virtual personas of the intervention 21 and this version was used in the present study.\n\nEmployees were informed about the intervention through various communication channels of a health insurance company to mimic real-life implementation, including printed magazines, email distribution lists, online postings and television announcements. It was emphasised that the intervention was aimed at employees who wanted to improve their sleep, mentally detach from work and actively recover. If interested, individuals could register for the study via a landing page for the training programme by leaving their email address and were asked to sign an informed consent form.\n\nRandomisation was performed by an independent researcher who was not involved in the study using the programme Randlist with a 1:1 ratio. After randomisation, participants were informed about their allocation by email and the intervention group received immediate access to the training programme. Meanwhile, the WLC had unrestricted access to treatment-as-usual and received access to the intervention after a waiting period of 6 months.\n\nInclusion criteria were: (1) at least 18 years old; (2) currently employed and exposed to blurred boundaries between work and non-work, measured as a score <2.25 on the segmentation supplies scale, thereby one SD below the scale’s mean value 7 ; and (3) moderate insomnia, measured as a score≥15 on the ISI. 18\n\nFor the sample size calculation, we considered previous meta-analyses on the effects of online CBT for insomnia 17 and the novelty of the intervention. Our calculation assumed an effect size of d=0.5 for the primary outcome post-intervention, which corresponds to 3 points on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Thus, a sample of N=128 individuals was required to detect the assumed effect with α=0.05 and 1-β = 0.80 in a two-tailed test.\n\nThis two-arm, parallel, randomised controlled trial (RCT)—comparing the internet-based intervention GET.ON Recovery with a WLC—was conducted at Leuphana University of Lüneburg and approved by the university’s ethics committee. The study protocol was registered at the German Clinical Trials Registry and results are reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement for non-pharmacological treatment trials. 16 Outcomes were measured pretreatment (T1), immediately post-treatment (8 weeks, T2) and 4 months after the intervention was completed (6-month follow-up, T3).\n\nFor the secondary outcomes, positive impacts for subjects in the intervention versus WLC group were detected at T2 and T3 for recuperation in sleep (d=1.40), depression (d=0.73), work-related rumination (d=0.29), worrying (d=0.69), detachment (d=1.10) and recreational activities (d=0.52). For most outcome measures, Bayesian statistics resulted in probabilities of roughly 99%, for the respective ANCOVA models, indicating that the differences between groups can be best explained by the model containing the variables baseline score and group. Concerning negative Work-Home-Interference, Bayesian analysis indicated that the difference (d=0.55) can be best explained by the ANCOVA model with a probability of 77%. The ANCOVA probabilities of negative Home-Work-Interference were 48%, for positive 27%, and for positive Work-Home-Interference 24% for the respective ANCOVA models. Concerning segmentation supplies, Bayesian ANCOVA estimated a probability of 21%. Sensitivity frequentist analysis revealed significant between-group differences for depression, recuperation in sleep, work-related rumination, worrying, detachment and recreational activities. Pertaining to working conditions, no significant intergroup differences were detected in segmentation supplies, positive or negative Home-Work-Interference, as well as positive and negative Work-Home-Interference.\n\nResults at 6-month follow-up were similar to those at T2, showing a large effect size (d=1.63; 95% CI=1.23 to 2.03) and a difference in ISI score versus T1 of 6.24 points. The Bayesian ANCOVA model with an informed prior exhibited the best model fit and highest Bayesian factors (BF 10 =1.27×e 70 and probability=99.99%, see online supplemental table S3 ). These results also were supported by classical frequentist ANCOVA (F=26.20, p<0.001) and by the analysis of the study-completers.\n\nFor Bayesian analysis, ANCOVA was performed on the main effect of the intervention with the ISI score as a covariate using data extracted from three previously-reported studies. For the main analysis, we compared four different models which are summarised in table 3 . The ANCOVA model, including both intervention group and baseline score as variables, exhibited the best model fit and highest Bayesian factor, with a BF 10 of 3.23×e 60 and probability of greater than 99.99%, indicating extremely strong evidence in favour of the alternative over null hypothesis. 35 This assumes the superiority of the intervention, thereby providing the strongest support for the model which included the covariate and group variable. Sensitivity analysis with Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow as a prior yielded a similar result, as did classical ANCOVA, implying that the differences in insomnia between the two study groups are highly unlikely to be explained by chance (F=86.94, p<0.001). Similar results could be shown by performing the analyses with only the study-completers (BF 10 of 1.09×e 10 and 98% probability; frequentist analysis: F=62.21, p<0.001)).\n\nTable 1 summarises the baseline characteristics of the study participants. As recommended in the CONSORT statement, 34 we refrained from testing for statistical baseline differences between the groups. A close examination of all baseline characteristics revealed no evidence of practically meaningful differences between the groups. In the intervention group, 51 out of 64 participants (80%) completed all six modules and only 8% requested feedback from the psychological e-coach.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe current study evaluated the effectiveness of an internet-based CBT training programme for employees in the general working population with sleep problems, exposed to blurred boundaries between work and non-work. Results suggest that the intervention was effective in reducing insomnia severity in the intervention group, relative to waiting list controls, short-term and long-term. Results were shown by both Bayesian and frequentist analyses with large effect sizes (d=1.51). Given that segmentation supplies remained stable throughout the intervention, we conclude that the intervention was successful at fostering employees’ skills in reducing work-related rumination and increasing mental detachment, even in adverse working conditions.\n\nIn general, our findings are consistent with results examining the effect of CBT-I on sleep. A meta-analysis identified average differences of 4.2915 in favour of CBT-I post-intervention, compared with 6.12 points in the present study, making the latter slightly greater. The NNT in our study, at just 1.60, is even less than in the results of a meta-analysis reported by Cheng and Dizon,17 in which the average NNT across the primary studies was 3.59. We observed a larger effect on work-related rumination (d=1.29) and detachment (d=1.10) than in Karabinski’s meta-analysis,14 in which an intervention effect of d=0.36 was reported for detachment defined as the absence of negative work-related thinking. The larger effects we observed might be explained by the present online intervention, featuring several exercises aimed specifically at helping individuals cope with blurred boundaries and foster detachment. Detachment and work-related rumination could thus be potential mediators in terms of sleep, aligning with the assumptions of the hyperarousal model of insomnia.11\n\nThe overall strong effects of GET.ON Recovery on insomnia, work-related rumination and mental detachment are noteworthy, especially given that the assumed underlying organisational risk factor—low segmentation supplies—remained largely unchanged. On one hand, this offers a hopeful perspective for workers affected by low segmentation supplies, as improvement is achievable even without changes in contextual factors. Nixon et al 36 observed a similar result, with perceived stress decreasing substantially following an online stress-management intervention, despite persistent workplace stressors. On the other hand, symptoms of insomnia on average remained elevated at a subclinical level, potentially reflecting the ongoing negative impact of adverse working conditions on employees. Therefore, individually-focused interventions may therefore have a ‘glass floor’, unable to reduce symptoms to normal levels unless complemented by organisation-based interventions.\n\nFrom a methodological perspective, this study, to the best of our knowledge, was the first to apply and compare Bayesian with the widely-used frequentist evaluation method in the field of sleep and occupational health. Using evidence-based prior from previous studies is a major advantage of the present study, addressing the common critique of employing weak priors.31 Regarding insomnia severity, we found that the posterior model odds are about 99.99%, indicating that the intervention is 99.99% certain to be superior to the control. This straightforward expression demonstrates a communicative advantage of Bayesian statistics: its direct and positive manner of presenting results, which seems easier for less statistics-savvy individuals to comprehend than reporting the rejection of a null hypothesis, stating that there is no difference using one-minus-probability expressions like p<0.001. For most secondary outcomes, we detected large BFs with high probabilities and very low p values via the frequentist approach, both of these providing empirical support for the intervention’s positive effects on mental health. Particularly interesting are findings where the Bayesian and frequentist approaches yield different conclusions: Since the frequentist approach adheres to a binary principle (significant or non-significant) that is specified by conventions (eg, p<0.05), a non-significant result is likely to lead to a rejection of the implementation of an intervention, disregarding contextual factors. For instance, in assessing positive and negative Home-Work- and Work-Home-Interference, no statistically-significant effects (p>0.05) were detected, leading to the conclusion that the intervention does not significantly improve these characteristics. From a Bayesian perspective, we observed a 77% probability that the intervention helps prevent negative spillover from work to home. Occupational health practitioners might inform employees who are seeking to reduce negative spillover effects about the 77% probability of a beneficial effect while discussing necessary costs, such as time or financial investment, required to take up the intervention. In a shared decision-making process, considering both the individual importance of the outcome and available alternatives, the help-seeker can draw their own conclusions and decide whether to uptake the intervention or not. Therefore, the results illustrate how the Bayesian perspective has the potential to empower people to make informed decisions by understanding the probability of benefits and considering the costs. Following recommendations proposed by Wijeysundera et al,37 the present study might serve as a blueprint for future trials in occupational health as a way to report both frequentist results and Bayesian posterior probabilities in RCTs.\n\nSeveral limitations should be considered: First, segmentation preferences were not assessed in our sample, and such preferences sometimes serve as a moderator between segmentation supplies and health-related outcomes.38 Therefore, the fit of preferences and supplies should be assessed in further research. Second, the long-term effects should be interpreted with caution, as we had a relatively high loss to follow-up of 44% at 6 months. Third, the results may not be generalisable to the implementation of the intervention as part of a company’s occupational health management. The provision of occupational e-mental health interventions by companies (workplace recruitment) appears to be associated with smaller effects than recruitment strategies that directly approach employees (community recruitment), as was the case in the present study. Lastly, no firm conclusions about the incremental effect of exercises promoting detachment and coping with low segmentation supplies can be drawn. Using a generic i-CBT-I intervention as a comparator in future studies would be informative.",

        "title": "Sociodemographic and clinical risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in functional/dissociative seizures and epilepsy: a large cohort study",
        "text": "To address this, the present study focuses on identifying factors associated with suicidality in two groups at elevated suicide risk: people with functional/dissociative seizures (FDS) and people with epilepsy. Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterised by an enduring propensity to experience epileptic seizures, that is, transient signs and/or symptoms of excessive or synchronous neuronal activity. 3 In people with epilepsy, suicide rates are three times those observed in the general population. 4 FDS are abrupt and observable episodes of altered behaviour or consciousness that superficially resemble epileptic seizures but are not associated with electroencephalography changes. 5 People with FDS have elevated suicide mortality rates (2.6–18.8%) as compared with the general population, 6–8 and the presence of FDS has been found to increase the risk of suicide attempt-related hospitalisation in people with epilepsy. 7\n\nSuicidal ideation (thinking about, considering or planning suicide) and suicide attempts (self-harm with intent to die) are strong predictive factors of suicide death; frameworks such as the three-step theory have been proposed to understand the development of ideation and its progression to action. 2 These immediate precursors of suicide can themselves lead to devastating consequences such as psychological burden, loss of employment, serious injury and disability. As certain factors might have greater or lesser influence in different clinical populations, there is urgent need to understand the risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts (collectively referred to as ‘suicidality’ hereafter) to recognise people at risk and inform public health strategies.\n\nSuicide is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and its prevention has been identified as a ‘global imperative’. 1 In the UK, the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health (2016) declared a national ambition of reducing suicide deaths by 10% by 2020. While national plans have been implemented to advance equality, coverage and access to mental health services, the clinical and academic community should lead in identifying high-risk groups for improved clinical risk assessment and targeted preventive programmes.\n\nSeveral risk factors for suicidality in epilepsy have been identified 9–12 ; we aim to provide additional evidence from a large cohort for the benefit of future aggregative studies like meta-analyses. On the other hand, evidence on the correlates of suicidality in FDS is scarce, with non-systematic reports from small samples. 13 14 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study whose primary aim is to systematically investigate the sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempt-related hospitalisation in this high-risk population.\n\nWe explored the association between sociodemographic and clinical factors and study outcomes separately for people with FDS and epilepsy. People were included independently of the diagnosis date. Our sample therefore includes people with a ‘lifetime diagnosis’, under the assumption that both disorders are associated with a neurobiological and neuropsychiatric phenotype existing even before seizure expression and diagnosis. To obtain an estimate of the total effect for each study variable, we first created causal diagrams describing the relationship between variables and outcomes, as recommended 17 ( online supplemental figures 1–4 ). These were built based on the clinical and academic expertise of a consultant neuropsychiatrist and a consultant psychiatrist (PS and AY). The diagrams were then used to guide variable entry in multivariable bias-reduced binomial-response generalised linear models 18 using the D3 likelihood ratio test for model comparison with multiply imputed data. 19 Age was assessed for non-linearity using restricted cubic splines, 20 where models with zero (linear) to five knots were compared in terms of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Lowest AIC were for three knots in epilepsy and four in FDS (locations indicated in the regression tables). Covariates for each model are specified as footnotes to the results tables. As a rule of thumb, analyses were only performed for variables having at least five supporting observations per cell in cross-tabulation with the outcome. 21 ORs and associated CIs were derived as a measure of association. Tjur’s coefficient of determination (pseudo-R 2 ) was used to quantify the amount of shared variance between variables and outcomes. 22 Significance level was 0.05. Data were analysed using R statistical software 23 V.4.2, with the ‘brglm’ (V.0.72) 24 and ‘mice’ (V.3.15) package. 25\n\nThe following hospital-coded information was extracted: age, gender, ethnicity and presence of comorbid neuropsychiatric diagnoses. Age at suicidal ideation and at suicide attempt was calculated; in the absence of suicidality, the age reported was the age at data extraction (18 June 2021) or age at death if deceased. Ethnicity was subdivided into white and other ethnicities (including Asian, black, mixed, multiple and other ethnicities). People were coded as having any neuropsychiatric diagnosis if at least one of the following disorders was recorded before the date of suicidal ideation or suicide attempt (or at any time if suicidality was not observed): substance misuse disorders (ICD-10: F10–F19), anxiety and stress-related disorders (including obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder; ICD-10: F40–F42, F43.1), bipolar disorder (ICD-10: F31) or depressive disorders (ICD-10: F32–F33), personality disorder (ICD-10: F60), pervasive developmental disorders or moderate-to-profound intellectual disability (ICD-10: F71–F73, F84).\n\nInformation on suicide attempt-related admissions was extracted from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) admission data linked to our cohort. HES collates national-level data routinely collected by NHS providers ( http://www.hscic.gov.uk/hes ). People with a first UK-registered hospital admission following suicide attempt (ICD-10: X60–X84) were considered cases of suicide attempt. Due to CRIS data access permissions, HES data were not extracted for patients under 18 years at the time of data collection, and for those who were only ever seen in SLaM Hospital NHS Foundation Trust while under the age of 18 years.\n\nThe study outcomes were a first report of suicidal ideation and first suicide attempt-related hospitalisation. Information on suicidal ideation was extracted using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application (app), using Generalised Architecture for Text Engineering and TextHunter software. 16 This has 87.8% precision and 91.7% recall to an instance of ideation. 16 To measure recall of the NLP app specifically for our sample, two researchers (IF, IJ) independently reviewed all 616 text snippets resulting in a positive ideation instance. It was coded whether this was a true and present instance (ie, active within 1 year before the snippet date) or a true past instance (ie, ever before the snippet date). Any disagreements were resolved upon discussion. Recall for present and past instances was 60% and 71%, respectively. Inter-rater agreement was almost perfect (95.3%, Cohen’s kappa=0.90). False positives were corrected to achieve higher accuracy in subsequent analyses.\n\nThe study’s source population were people attending SLaM between 01 January 2007 and 18 June 2021. Inclusion criteria were a primary or secondary diagnosis of epilepsy (International Classification of Diseases, version 10 (ICD-10) code G40) or FDS (ICD-10: F44.5). We also extracted data for people with concurrent diagnosis of epilepsy and FDS, which were used in a previous study based on the same data 7 ; however, the small sample size prevented us from investigating risk and protective factors for this group. Exclusion criteria were a primary or secondary diagnosis of psychotic disorder (ICD-10: F20–F29) or structural brain disease, including cerebral malignancy (ICD-10: C71, C79.3, D43.0–D43.2, D49.6), traumatic brain injury (ICD-10: S01, S02, S06, S07, S09), dementia or progressive neurodegenerative disease (ICD-10: F00–F03).\n\nThis is a retrospective cohort study. Data were extracted by a research nurse using the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS), 15 a system providing de-identified information from South London and Maudsley National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust (SLaM) electronic heath records. SLaM is the largest tertiary mental healthcare provider in Europe, with a catchment of four boroughs in southeast London with a population of over 1.2 million people, hosting the only NHS national specialist tertiary service in the UK offering assessment and treatment of severe dissociative disorders, including FDS.\n\nResults of the bias-reduced logistic regression indicated that as age of people with FDS increases, there is a significant decrease in the odds of suicidal ideation (up to age 33/knot location: OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.90) and suicide attempt-related hospitalisation (up to age 32/knot location: OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.86; figure 1 ). After age 33 or 32 years, risk increases again until age 47 years before declining ( tables 4 and 5 and figure 1 ). Both genders had similar odds for suicidality ( tables 4 and 5 ). The odds of people of Asian, black, mixed, multiple and other ethnicities of experiencing suicidal ideation were significantly higher (2.4 times) than people of white ethnicity (OR: 2.40; 95% CI: 1.63, 3.53). However, people of white ethnicity were 1/0.49=2.0 times more likely to have an admission following suicide attempt (OR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.92). For suicidal ideation, the odds of people with comorbid depression or bipolar disorder were significantly higher compared with those without these diagnoses (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.22, 3.00). The same was true for comorbid personality disorder (OR: 3.01; 95% CI: 1.37, 6.63). There was no association between suicidal ideation and a diagnosis of anxiety or stress-related disorders ( table 4 ). For suicide attempt, it was only possible to explore the association with a diagnosis of depression or bipolar disorder (non-significant; table 5 ) due to low cell counts for the other comorbidities. Reporting previous ideation was not associated with subsequent suicide attempt-related admission (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.33, 1.16). Predictors explained between 0% and 15.7% of the variance in the outcomes studied ( online supplemental tables 3 and 4 ).\n\nLoess smoothed (local non-linear regression) curves showing probability of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt-related hospitalisation by age per each diagnostic group. (Top left) Probability of suicidal ideation by age in epilepsy; (bottom left) probability of suicide attempt-related admission by age in epilepsy; (top right) probability of suicidal ideation by age in FDS; (bottom right) probability of suicide attempt-related admission by age in FDS. On the negative side of the y axis are depicted the age distributions (number of cases) stratified by presence of outcome (blue: suicidal ideation/suicide attempt present; yellow: suicidal ideation/suicide attempt absent). FDS, functional/dissociative seizures.\n\nResults of the bias-reduced logistic regression indicated that in people with epilepsy, there is a significant non-linear association between age and suicidal ideation; odds were stable until the knot location (age 33 years; OR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.05) before declining (OR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.98; table 2 and figure 1 ). Age had a significant quadratic association with suicide attempt-related admission, with risk increasing until age 33/knot before declining ( table 3 and figure 1 ). Both genders had similar odds of experiencing suicidal ideation (OR: 1.27; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.75). For suicide attempt, the odds of females were significantly higher than males (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.56). Ethnicity was not associated with suicidal ideation (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.66, 1.38). The odds of people of white ethnicity being admitted following suicide attempt were significantly higher (1/0.45=2.22 times) as compared with other ethnic backgrounds (Asian, black, mixed, multiple and other; OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.85). The odds of people with a substance misuse disorder of experiencing suicidal ideation were 2.67 times the odds of people without (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.61, 4.74). The presence of a pervasive developmental disorder or intellectual disability was associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of suicidal ideation (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.39) and suicide attempt-related admission (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.35). There was no association between outcomes and a diagnosis of depression or bipolar disorder, or anxiety or stress-related disorders ( tables 2 and 3 ). Reporting suicidal ideation did not affect the likelihood of subsequent suicide attempt-related admission (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.49, 2.18). See online supplemental material for D3 likelihood ratio test. R 2 values were low; predictor variables explained between 0% and 3.8% of the variance in the outcomes studied ( online supplemental tables 1 and 2 ).\n\n1040 people with FDS were included. 17.5% reported suicidal ideation, while 12.4% had a hospital admission following suicide attempt ( table 1 ). 75% were females, and the predominant ethnicity was white. A neuropsychiatric comorbidity was present in approximately 20%, the most common being depression or bipolar disorder (11%) and anxiety and stress-related disorders (8.5%).\n\n1343 people with epilepsy were included. 12.7% reported suicidal ideation, while 6.1% had a hospital admission following suicide attempt ( table 1 ). There was a similar proportion of males and females, and the predominant ethnicity was white. 57% had at least one neuropsychiatric comorbidity, the most common being pervasive developmental disorders or intellectual disability (31.9%). Other common comorbidities were anxiety or stress-related disorders (12%), and depression or bipolar disorders (12%).\n\nDiscussion and clinical implications\n\nThis work sought to identify the sociodemographic and comorbidity correlates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt-related hospital admissions in large cohorts of people with FDS or epilepsy. We studied group-specific associations with age, gender, ethnicity and comorbid neuropsychiatric diagnoses. We present novel findings for risk factors in the population with FDS which have not been previously studied.\n\nWe identify factors that have similar relationships with suicidality across the two groups, indicating that these are more likely to be general risk factors, rather than specific to a particular clinical population.\n\nFor both cohorts, ethnicity accounted for a small proportion of the observed variance in suicide attempt-related hospitalisation (0.5–0.6%). However, a consistent association was observed; people of Asian, black, mixed, multiple or other backgrounds had significantly reduced odds for such hospitalisations (51–55% reduction) compared with people of white ethnicity. These results align with the largest UK community study,26 highlighting that people of ethnic minorities are half as likely to receive medical attention following suicide attempt than people of white ethnicity. In our study, this was observed despite ethnic minorities having significantly higher odds of reporting suicidal ideation in part of our sample (FDS group, OR: 2.4). It has been suggested that scarcer service accessibility or fear of stigma may deter individuals from ethnic minorities seeking medical attention after suicide attempts.26 Further research is required to understand this; if appropriate, efforts should be implemented to reduce stigmatisation and improve service access for ethnic minorities following suicide attempts.\n\nIn both cohorts, reporting suicidal ideation was not associated with a higher likelihood of subsequent suicide attempt-related admission. Our measure of suicidal ideation relied on NLP of clinical notes rather than systematic assessment, and it is uncertain if ideation was reported elsewhere. Nevertheless, our results highlight the difficulty of predicting suicide attempts among people experiencing suicidal ideation, as most do not progress to actual attempts.27 28\n\nWe have identified a number of risk and protective factors for suicidality that are unique to each diagnostic group.\n\nIn people with FDS, both genders had comparable odds of reporting suicidal ideation and of being hospitalised following a suicide attempt. This indicates that although the FDS group has a high prevalence (75%) of females, both genders are at similar suicidality risk. This is a novel finding which has not been previously reported. In people with epilepsy, no gender effect was observed for suicidal ideation; this is in line with results from a large meta-regression29 but not another,4 indicating the need for additional investigation. However, females with epilepsy had significantly higher odds of having a suicide attempt-related admission (OR: 1.64; 0.4% variance explained), in line with some previous evidence11 28 but not another.29\n\nIn people with FDS, age was significantly associated with a first instance of suicidal ideation and first suicide attempt-related hospitalisation, each explaining 8.8% and 15.7% of the outcome variance, respectively. Consistent with previous studies in the general population,30 we observed that adolescence and early adulthood are periods of greatest risk of onset of suicidality in FDS, with risk varying non-linearly as a function of age.\n\nIn epilepsy, age had a significant non-linear association with both suicidality outcomes, explaining 1.1–1.2% of their variance. Consistent with the probability distribution observed in this study, previous evidence indicates that people with epilepsy tend to complete suicide later in life (in their 40s) compared with those without epilepsy.31 32 This might relate to the highest prevalence of epilepsy occurring in the 35–64 years age group,32 although our sample distribution does not support this, as it includes a high proportion of cases under 30 years old. Suicidality in epilepsy is multifaceted and may have distinct underlying mechanisms compared with those driving the suicidality peak observed in adolescence and early adulthood in FDS or the general population. Epilepsy-related and psychosocial factors, treatment responsiveness and the shared neurobiological substrate between depression and epilepsy33 may contribute to a more chronic vulnerability to suicidality later in life.\n\nAnalysis of five comorbidity classes revealed that suicidality in FDS and epilepsy is associated with a distinct pattern of neuropsychiatric comorbidities.\n\nIn people with epilepsy, those with a comorbid diagnosis of substance misuse had 167% higher odds of reporting suicidal ideation (1.1% variance explained), consistently with reports from a recent meta-analysis.34 As previously reported,12 we found that a strong protective factor against suicidal ideation (76% reduction in odds) and suicide attempt-related admissions (84% reduction) was a diagnosis of moderate-to-profound intellectual disability or pervasive developmental disorder such as autism, Rett syndrome and Asperger syndrome. This explained 2–2.9% of the variance in suicidality outcomes and is the driver of the seemingly ‘protective’ effect of having ‘any neuropsychiatric comorbidity’ observed in results tables. An impaired communication of thoughts and emotions might contribute to under-reported suicidal ideation in populations with pervasive developmental disorder/intellectual disability; these may also have only a partial understanding of the concepts of life and death, which serves as the basis of forming suicide intent.35 The reasons driving this finding should be a matter of further study.\n\nIn people with epilepsy, diagnoses of depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety or stress-related disorders (including obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder) were not associated with suicidality. While meta-analysis results suggest an overall weak association between anxiety, related disorders and suicidality,36 our finding of a lack of association for depressive disorders is surprising, as these have been reported as the major risk factor for suicidal ideation in epilepsy.10 However, recent meta-analysis results also suggest that depression might not effectively predict suicide attempts.27 Our results may be due to sample-specific characteristics, to sampling from a large tertiary mental health hospital or to limitations in capturing relevant factors such as disorder severity or hopelessness using ICD-10 codes for depression.2 37 These results should be better understood in future meta-analyses.\n\nIn people with FDS, the odds of experiencing suicidal ideation were 200% higher in those with a comorbid diagnosis of personality disorder, and this accounted for 2.9% of the variance. Suicidality is a central feature of the personality disorder subtypes strongly associated with FDS,38 such as borderline personality disorder. The risk of reporting suicidal ideation was also higher in the presence of a diagnosis of depression or bipolar disorder (91% increase in odds, 3% variance explained), although this did not translate to an increased risk of suicide attempt-related hospitalisation in this group. Again, as depressive disorders are strongly associated with suicidality, these results do not imply an absence of increased risk and should be considered in future aggregative studies for a more comprehensive interpretation. It was not possible to estimate the association between suicide attempt-related admissions and a comorbid diagnosis of anxiety or stress-related disorders, personality disorders, substance misuse disorder or pervasive developmental disorder due to low numbers in this group.\n\nFigure 2 includes a summary of clinically relevant study findings for the FDS group.\n\nFigure 2 Summary of main findings on risk factors for suicidality in people with FDS. FDS, functional/dissociative seizures.\n\nThis study’s major strength is the sizeable patient sample (n=2383) from the UK largest tertiary mental health hospital, spanning 15 years. Linkage to national admission data from the HES ensured that hospitalisation could be captured independently from location of the admitting hospital. However, non-admissions following suicide attempt, estimated to be 50% of those attempting suicide,39 were not considered. Cases of suicidal ideation were not captured if unreported or undocumented during hospital appointments at our site. Our NLP app for identifying ideation had 60–71% recall and an estimated 91.7% precision; while all false positives were corrected prior to analyses, a proportion of relevant instances might have been missed. Severity and frequency of ideation were not assessed.\n\nDue to the study’s retrospective nature, information on how the diagnoses of epilepsy or FDS were arrived at was not available, and a degree of misdiagnosis might be present; for epilepsy, this is estimated to be between 4.6% and 5.6% following specialist review.40 We expect minimal misdiagnosis rates for FDS due to the hospital’s high specialisation for FDS. Our use of ICD-10 codes for identifying comorbid disorders might underestimate their true prevalence.\n\nOur patient cohort might differ from that of community studies because of sampling from a tertiary mental health hospital. For example, our epilepsy sample showed a higher prevalence of at least one of the psychiatric comorbidities under study (57%), compared with the typically reported 30% prevalence for psychiatric comorbidities in epilepsy.41 Results may also vary under different theoretical assumptions (diagrams).",
        "summary": "To address this, the present study focuses on identifying factors associated with suicidality in two groups at elevated suicide risk: people with functional/dissociative seizures (FDS) and people with epilepsy. We explored the association between sociodemographic and clinical factors and study outcomes separately for people with FDS and epilepsy. People were included independently of the diagnosis date. These were built based on the clinical and academic expertise of a consultant neuropsychiatrist and a consultant psychiatrist (PS and AY). Lowest AIC were for three knots in epilepsy and four in FDS (locations indicated in the regression tables). As a rule of thumb, analyses were only performed for variables having at least five supporting observations per cell in cross-tabulation with the outcome. 25\n\nThe following hospital-coded information was extracted: age, gender, ethnicity and presence of comorbid neuropsychiatric diagnoses. Ethnicity was subdivided into white and other ethnicities (including Asian, black, mixed, multiple and other ethnicities). The study outcomes were a first report of suicidal ideation and first suicide attempt-related hospitalisation. Recall for present and past instances was 60% and 71%, respectively. Inter-rater agreement was almost perfect (95.3%, Cohen’s kappa=0.90). The study’s source population were people attending SLaM between 01 January 2007 and 18 June 2021. We also extracted data for people with concurrent diagnosis of epilepsy and FDS, which were used in a previous study based on the same data 7 ; however, the small sample size prevented us from investigating risk and protective factors for this group. SLaM is the largest tertiary mental healthcare provider in Europe, with a catchment of four boroughs in southeast London with a population of over 1.2 million people, hosting the only NHS national specialist tertiary service in the UK offering assessment and treatment of severe dissociative disorders, including FDS. After age 33 or 32 years, risk increases again until age 47 years before declining ( tables 4 and 5 and figure 1 ).

        "title": "US Senate to vote to extend foreign surveillance Bill",
        "text": "The United States Senate is set to vote on legislation that would extend the US’ Wiretap program for surveillance of non-Americans. ‘The Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act (RISAA )’, also drastically increases the number of businesses that the US government can force to conduct surveillance on non-Americans without a warrant. The Bill would allow the US government to order commercial spaces like data centres and buildings owned by commercial landlords, who merely have access to communications equipment in their physical space to conduct surveillance on non-American citizens, experts said.\n\nWhat is the Legislation?\n\nThe ‘Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act’ (RISAA) is a legislation to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The 702 program allows the American government to conduct surveillance on foreign citizens through, “electronic communications service providers.” This means that US businesses providing services such as e-mails, phone calls, text messages, etc. are required to assist the government in intercepting communication.\n\nThe Bill was passed in the House and is up for vote in the Senate. The recent amendments made to RISSA majorly concern themselves with protecting the privacy of American citizens and strengthening oversight over security bodies. However, the Bill also aims to expand the definition of “electronic communications service providers” (ECSP). Section 25 of the Bill expands the definition of ECSP to include “any service provider who has access to wire or electronic communications either as such communications are transmitted or as such communications are stored or equipment that is being or may be used to transmit or store such communications” and “an officer, employee, or agent or custodian of any such entity.”\n\nCriticisms of the Bill\n\nExpansion of ECSP\n\nThe 702 program, before the Bill, compelled businesses such as large telecom operators like AT&T and communication services providers like Google, Meta, etc. to cooperate with the Government’s orders to intercept communication However, Marc Zwillinger, a private attorney noted on his blog that under the new Bill,:\n\n“The expanded definition would appear to cover data centers, colocation providers, business landlords, shared workspaces, or even hotels where guests connect to the Internet. And the addition of the term “custodian” … could be understood to sweep in any third party involved in providing equipment, storage, or even cleaning services to such entities.”\n\nIt is worth noting that the Bill exempts few spaces such as hotels, libraries, restaurants. However, various privacy organisations have criticised the broad scope of the Bill. The Committee to Protect Journalists, along with over 70 civil society organizations signed a letter urging the Senate to oppose the Bill. They said that by including businesses that have access to equipment such as routers the Bill also requires commercial landlords that rent out the office space to provides access to their communication channels. These could include news media headquarters, political campaign offices, advocacy and grassroots organizations, lobbying firms, and law offices, they said. The letter stated that “it would dramatically expand the government’s warrantless surveillance powers without providing adequate protections for journalists.”\n\nFurther, the letter said,\n\n“This “Everyone Is A Spy” Provision fundamentally transforms the nature of surveillance in this country by requiring American businesses and individuals that have no role in providing communications services to assist with NSA surveillance.”\n\nNo warrant required\n\nIn the past, there have been multiple instances of the FBI abusing Section 702 for spying on American citizens. A declassified report from 2023, showed that the FBI spied on Black Lives Matter protestors and January 6 Capitol Hill protestors, journalists, political donors and a sitting member of the US Congress.\n\nThe amendments seek to increase oversight over the FBI and its collection of data of US citizens and thus positions itself as progressive . However, many have criticized the fact that the House voted against the amendment that would require the FBI to have a warrant before conducting surveillance on someone. Ron Wyden, a senator for the state of Oregon, in a statement noted these past abuses from the FBI and explained how the current amendments are inadequate.\n\nHe said, “the broader concern is that without checks and balances, there is nothing preventing a rapid increase of abuses after reauthorization. Supporters of this bill will say that it codifies the FBI’s internal changes. But without checks and balances, what good are those changes?”.\n\nWyden and other reformers call for a “modest reform”, that would require the FBI to have warrants, but only if they want to read the communication of a US citizen. Notably, he explicitly states that the reform would still allow the Government to check if a US citizen was communicating with “foreign targets”.\n\nHistory of Section 702\n\nSection 702 in its current form was added as an amendment to FISA in 2008. The Amendment was a response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2000. The US Government spotted a gap in its intelligence legislation with the evolution of technology. Those considered “foreign adversaries” by American security forces often used e-mail, text messages, etc. to communicate. However, before Section 702, the government had to seek individual court orders, based on a finding of probable cause, to obtain the communications, despite, these communication services were controlled largely by American companies. Thus citing threats to national security, Section 702 was introduced, allowing the American Government to access this information without the constraints of a judicial process. Section 702 only allows surveillance of people who are not citizens of the United States. United States citizens and anyone located in the United States cannot be targeted under Section 702. Further, Section 702 prohibits “reverse targeting”— where a person located outside the U.S. can be used to collect information about a United States person or anyone located in the United States.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nSTAY ON TOP OF TECH NEWS: Our daily newsletter with the top story of the day from MediaNama, delivered to your inbox before 9 AM.

        "text": "WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging apps, with the highest user base in India. The biggest part of its success is the platform’s focus on safety and security, and the company makes sure to take swift action on suspicious activity in order to prevent its misuse. It shut down fraudulent or harmful accounts, and recently, the Meta-owned messaging app banned over 76 lakh accounts in India in the month of February, in compliance with the IT Rules, 2021.\n\nBetween February 1 and February 29, a total of 7,628,000 WhatsApp accounts were banned, and 1,424,000 were proactively banned before any reports from users, according to the company’s monthly compliance report.\n\nHowever, despite the fact that WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted, WhatsApp keeps track of several meta data.\n\nWhatsApp, on its official website, clearly states that if they find any user doing these 5 things and violating its “Terms of Service,” it may trigger the platform to ban the account.\n\n1. If you use third-party apps like WhatsApp Delta, GBWhatsApp, WhatsApp Plus, etcWhatsApp doesn’t permit users to communicate over a third-party application like WhatsApp Delta, GBWhatsApp, WhatsApp Plus, etc., due to privacy concerns. WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption is one of the biggest reasons for the app’s popularity, and using unofficial WhatsApp apps comes with greater security risks. Hence, always use the official and verified versions of the WhatsApp app available on the Google Play Store and App Store to communicate to avoid the risk of a ban on WhatsApp forever.\n\n2. If you impersonate someone and a create a fake account of another personOpening a WhatsApp account with someone else’s details can also get you banned from the platform. This includes impersonating celebrities, organisations, public figures, brands, or other users. If WhatsApp discovers that you are impersonating someone, it clearly states that your account may be permanently banned.\n\n3. If you send too many messages to someone who is not on your contact listAs per the company’s Terms of Service, if a user misuses the platform and spams people who are not in their contact list, WhatsApp will ban their WhatsApp account. WhatsApp will take action if the user sends illegal or impermissible communications, such as auto-messaging, bulk messaging, auto-dialing, and so on.\n\n4. If too many users blocked or report against your WhatsApp accountIf multiple users block or report your number on WhatsApp in a short period of time, your account is likely to be flagged on WhatsApp’s system, irrespective of whether these people are on your contact list or not. WhatsApp may consider your account a source of spam messages or fake news to prevent fraud on the platform.\n\n5. Sending threatening, fake and illegal messages or videos that promote violenceThreatening users, sharing illegal content, or spreading hateful and offensive content that promotes violent crimes, endangers, or exploits children or others is yet another way to get your WhatsApp account banned.\n\nAccording to its Terms of Service, WhatsApp clearly warns that you can’t send “illegal, defamatory, obscene, intimidating, threatening, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive” content on the app.",

        "text": "Seán Kelly and Simon Harris: Seán's enthusiasm for a good photo opportunity got the better of him. Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA Wire\n\nThe Oireachtas Children’s Committee met representatives of social media companies again this week to discuss artificial intelligence and the safeguarding of children using social media.\n\nWitnesses from Meta, TikTok and the cesspit formerly known as Twitter appeared on Tuesday afternoon to resume their very earnest engagement with the politicians, smoothly explaining how protecting kiddies from dangerous and unsuitable content on their platforms is paramount in everything they do.\n\nThe TDs and Senators were not convinced.\n\nFianna Fáil Senator Erin McGreehan summed up the polite but sceptical mood with her opening line: “You’re very welcome to today’s committee. A lot of questions and topics have been thrashed out already today but I think we all will agree that social media is an absolute cesspit.”\n\nREAD MORE\n\nIndependent Senator Tom Clonan pitched his questions from the perspective of a middle-aged layman who is not particularly tech savvy but asked questions which concerned parents are asking about the material their children can see.\n\n“Forgive me if some of the questions sound like stupid questions,” he said. “I come from the position of being a layperson, although I do use all of the platforms except TikTok… because I saw what it did to Simon Harris, God help him.”\n\n“It made him Taoiseach!” pointed out Fianna Fáil’s Malcolm Byrne as TDs and Senators fell around the place laughing.\n\nThe witness from TikTok looked thrilled.\n\nTom explained.\n\n“It’s just taken over his life entirely. He is the TikTok Taoiseach. It has taken over his life entirely, it’s gone in an unanticipated direction.”\n\nTo a big new office in Government Buildings, God help him.\n\nPhoto opportunities\n\nFine Gael’s Seán Kelly is some man for the photo opportunities.\n\nHe’s his party’s equivalent of a heat-seeking missile, only in this case, the target is any high-ranking politician in front of a camera.\n\nWitness Simon Harris’s inaugural ardfheis address two weeks ago in Galway. Seán was up on that platform like a Kerry mountain goat the second the speech was over, finishing in his favourite position near the leader’s shoulder.\n\nHowever, Seán’s enthusiasm got the better of him last Friday at the launch of Daniel Butler’s bid to become the first directly elected mayor of Limerick.\n\nTaoiseach and new party leader Simon Harris travelled to Limerick racecourse in Patrickswell for the occasion and a host of FG luminaries from the Treaty City and beyond gathered to greet him. Munster MEP Kelly was among the welcoming party when he arrived.\n\nThere were speeches for the faithful in the Greenmount Suite and then oodles of lovely photo ops. There were lots of people vying for the Taoiseach’s attention on the platform. “It was like the start of the Grand National before the tape goes up,” is how one witness overdescribed it.\n\nThen there was an unmerciful crash as the bould Seán toppled over the edge and into a large pop-up backdrop. If that wasn’t bad enough, there was a table with empty glasses behind and he fell on that too after the “spider” frame supporting the large Fine Gael poster collapsed.\n\n“You know that song I believe I Can Fly? Well, he can’t,” added our FG informant, who seemed to be taking far too much pleasure in this unfortunate mishap.\n\nHappily, MEP Kelly is a hardy buck. Straight back on the Munster Euro election trail for the elections in June. Not a bother on him.\n\nTurning dreams into realities\n\nCongratulations to Roscommon-Galway TD Denis Naughten, who recently graduated from DCU with an MA in science and health communications. We always knew the former minister for communications Denis was a bit of a science nerd.\n\nDenis is chairman of the global Inter-Parliamentary Union’s working group on science and technology and convener of the Oireachtas Friends of Science and Technology group.\n\nRoscommon-Galway TD Denis Naughten recently graduated from DCU with an MA\n\nHe was studying for a PhD in food microbiology in UCC when he was elected to the Dáil in 1997 and promptly abandoned academia for a life in politics.\n\n“I’d been looking at this course for years and was going to go for it in 2016 but, bizarrely, I got into government at that stage,” says the independent TD for Roscommon-Galway. “But it was always in the back of my mind.”\n\nDenis – he has a degree in industrial microbiology from UCD – recognised the benefits of remote working during Covid and he decided to go back to college and enrol in the two-year part-time course. The first year was mainly online and in the second year he attended a mix of online and in-person lectures.\n\nEarlier this year he announced his retirement from national politics for personal and professional reasons after 26 years of unbroken service in the Dáil.\n\nAfter the graduation ceremony two weeks ago he wrote: “As I close this chapter and look forward to the next, I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. This qualification is not just an academic achievement; it is a testament to the power of determination, collaboration, and the support of those around us.\n\n“Here’s to new beginnings, to the endless possibilities that education opens up, and to all those who dream big and work hard to turn those dreams into reality.”\n\nConference highlights\n\nAnother weekend, another party conference.\n\nThis time the Greens will be gracing our TV screens on Saturday evening with a live leader’s address. Set your tellies to record.\n\nThe schedule for the day is jam-packed with a succession of speakers up and down to the microphone at a bewildering rate. The podium will be worn to the ground with the traffic by the time Eamon Ryan reaches it.\n\nSome speakers are limited to just five minutes while the longest 30-minute slots have been set aside for panel discussions.\n\nSome of the highlights include “Seven Weeks to Go!” from director of local elections, Roderic O’Gorman, “on the battle for attention in the final campaign’s final week”.\n\nAnd a “Don’t forget the other election!” rallying cry from Brian Leddin TD who is one in a very crowded field in the race to become the first directly elected mayor of Limerick.\n\nClare-based Senator Róisín Garvey has one of the toughest tasks with 20 minutes to delight delegates on the subject of “What have the Greens ever done for us?” If she’s short of material, Róisín can Google Mattie McGrath’s Dáil contributions on the question.\n\nMinister for Media Catherine Martin will be teeing up her party leader with a seven-minute warm-up speech. But she will feature only very briefly on the live transmission and will be off the stage before anybody from Prime Time tries to book her for an encore.\n\nEamon Ryan will speak for a whopping 25 minutes.\n\nBut the longest amount of speaking time has been allotted to a comedian. Colm O’Regan, author of the book Climate Warrior, will do the main warm-up with a 40-minute comedy sketch.\n\nSinn Féin and the EU\n\nAontú leader Peadar Tóibín accused the Government of ceding Ireland’s sovereignty to the European Union with its support of the EU migration pact. How can the Irish people have a say in lawmaking for this country “when decisions are made in Brussels or Berlin”?\n\nThe Taoiseach asked him: “Do you not want to be a member of the European Parliament? Are you not running for election because you want to be there making decisions?”\n\n“We do but we don’t want to cede any more sovereignty” was the reply.\n\nEventually, the discussion came around to Peadar’s former party. He was first elected a TD when a member of Sinn Féin. If we were to go by the policy of the party when he was still in it, Ireland wouldn’t even be in the EU, said the Taoiseach, because not so long ago, Sinn Féin wanted no truck with Europe.\n\nThere was a chorus of protest from the SF benches across the floor.\n\n“You voted against it every single time,” said Minister of State Neale Richmond.\n\n“Did you not oppose every referendum?”\n\nHarris was momentarily distracted. “Sorry, Deputy McDonald is muttering something I can’t hear.”\n\nThe Sinn Féin leader was not amused.\n\n“It’s a statement of fact that Sinn Féin has opposed every European referendum since we joined the European Union, including the one to join the European Union. That’s the truth,” said Simon.\n\nMary Lou was thoroughly cheesed off.\n\n“It is so utterly dull that we’re hearing this in the Dáil,” she sighed wearily. “New Taoiseach. Old fogey, young fogey.”\n\nSimon did a double take, repeating the words back to her.\n\n“Old fogey, young fogey?”\n\nWhat did that mean?\n\nIt must mean Leo Varadkar is now an old fogey. He’ll be delighted to hear that.",

        "text": "Meta-musical “A Strange Loop” tells the story of Usher, a Black, queer writer penning a musical about a Black, queer writer penning a musical about a Black, queer writer.\n\nActor Kai Clifton, who plays Usher in the upcoming Boston production of the show, is also a Black, queer writer.\n\n“We’re extremely similar,” Clifton told the Herald of the parallels between actor and character. “There’s a strange loop within a strange loop for me here.”\n\nHold on, more loops are coming.\n\nSpeakEasy Stage Company and Front Porch Arts Collective bring “A Strange Loop” to the Wimberly Theatre April 26 to May 25 after the show’s impressive Off-Broadway and Broadway run. Writer Michael R. Jackson’s work won the Pulitzer Prize in 2020 and two Tonys in 2022 including best musical. The success is even more impressive considering how outside the mainstream it is for a Broadway show — the action mainly takes place in Usher’s mind as the character acts as an usher at “The Lion King,” a job Jackson had for four years.\n\nIt’s the kind of success Clifton never thought they would see.\n\n“It’s such a privilege to play a role that I can understand so well and whose identity is so specific to mine,” Clifton said. “I can’t help but think about all the people that came before me who identified with Usher but didn’t get to see their story told on stage.”\n\nDespite being a veteran of musical theater and a star student — Clifton studied at Italy’s Assisi Performing Arts Program on a full scholarship — they had never seen a Broadway musical while it was on Broadway. But after coming across a promotional clip for “A Strange Loop,” they knew they had to make the pilgrimage.\n\n“I remember sitting in the audience not knowing what I was getting myself into,” they said with a laugh. “After the show, after that rollercoaster of a feeling, I remember looking up at the marquee and saying, ‘I have to play this role. I don’t know where, when or how, but I know it’s going to happen.”\n\nA Boston native, Clifton has made their name across New England in a range of venues. They have dug into drama as Sofia in “The Color Purple” and won the 2022 Broadway World Boston Award for Best New Play or Musical for writing “Queens,” about the lives of four queer Black men. They have made kids giggle and gasp as Ursula in “The Little Mermaid” and Gloria in “Madagascar.” What they haven’t done much of is sing in their natural voice.\n\n“Recently, I’ve played a lot of roles in drag,” they said. “These are roles written for an alto, mezzo-soprano woman, and I can sing them. But Michael R. Jackson has written this glorious score for a pure tenor, which is so refreshing. These songs are truly beautiful, the lyrics so raw and honest.”\n\n“This is not only a role that looks like me, but sounds like me,” they added.\n\nClifton knows not everyone will be drawn to the musical the way they were, not everyone will be looped in in the same way. But they are confident everyone will connect with Usher.\n\n“You will find something that’s so relatable in this character,” they said.\n\nFor tickets and details visit speakeasystage.com",

        "text": "Tens of billions of dollars have poured into AI companies looking to use the technology to revolutionise everything from medicine to education over the past year. But concerns about the technology – both its power and potential to disrupt work and life – have also grown.\n\nA report released Monday by Stanford University shows just how much those possibilities, and very real worries, have come to the fore since OpenAI launched its ChatGPT chatbot that sent the artificial intelligence industry into overdrive.\n\n\"A decade ago, the best AI systems in the world were unable to classify objects in images at a human level,\" struggling with language comprehension and math like a grade schooler, wrote Ray Perrault, one of the directors of the AI Index, released annually by the Stanford Human-Centered AI institute.\n\n\"Today, AI systems routinely exceed human performance,\" he said. But those leaps in ability and processing power have come with problems. Perrault said that while 2023 saw the number of large language processing AI programs double, the technology “cannot reliably deal with facts, perform complex reasoning, or explain its conclusions”.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe report states unequivocally that AI has achieved levels of performance that surpass human capabilities across a range of tasks. But much of that progress happened before last year.\n\nAI models reliably beat their human counterparts in classifying images nearly a decade ago, outstripping people in basic reading comprehension in 2017. By 2020, the report said, the programs were often able to outdo the human brain in visual reasoning, and by 2021, in natural language inference.\n\nMore complex tasks, such as advanced-level math and understanding what images mean, are still firmly the domain of human beings. For instance, when a bot recognises that two people in a photo are playing music in a street, it's still a tough test to reason that they're busking and not playing poker.\n\nStill, AI's ability to perform those kinds of combined tasks, such as analysing a photo and describing it in text, have gotten significantly better.\n\nOne example from the report shows how an AI system can take an image of ingredients for a meal and coach a user through turning eggs into an omelet, even nudging the user to flip it and cook a while long after seeing a photo of the not-quite-done product.\n\nOther advances, such as being able to create extremely photorealistic images of faces, have improved massively during the past two years. The image program Midjourney as recently as two years ago could only create rough images that were easily identifiable as AI, the report found.\n\nNow websites like www.whichfaceisreal.com provide extremely challenging AI identification tasks where even the most eagle-eyed observers will struggle to identify the synthetic image.\n\nRisks\n\nAll of that means it is much easier to make and distribute AI-generated content for malicious purposes, from political deepfakes to gargantuan waves of disinformation.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers are trying to require companies to identify when they use AI in advertising, and to more broadly watermark AI outputs. But although AI developers such as Meta and OpenAI are on board, those efforts present technical challenges and might not yet be possible. Not to mention questions about compliance and how to police bad actors.\n\nOther problems with the technology are on the rise as well.\n\nIn 2023, the AI Incident Database, which tallies AI misuse and harms, saw 123 reports, a 32.3% increase from 2022. The database tracks issues like autonomous cars injuring pedestrians, or facial recognition tools leading to arrests of the wrong person.\n\nImage- and text-based AI models can also output copyrighted material, the report said. Examples included Midjourney outputting near exact depictions of Toy Story and Marvel Comics characters when asked to, revealing that those images were probably part of their training data.\n\nLegislation is already being proposed to tamp down potential copyright violations. But it is a developing area of the law, and some AI companies have argued they have a fair use right to some copyrighted material to train their programs.\n\nEconomics\n\nWhile corporate investment in AI technology reached US$189.2bil (RM907bil) globally in 2023, that was actually a decrease of about one-fifth compared to 2022, according to the report, mostly due to a significant fall in mergers and acquisitions in the space.\n\nBut funding for generative AI companies – those like OpenAI whose technology generates images, text and increasingly video – saw a sharp uptick in 2023. The sector attracted US$25.2bil (RM120.8bil), which was around nine times the money plowed into it in 2022.\n\nThe demand for AI skills in the workforce has also leveled off, according to the Stanford report and data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.\n\n\"Nearly every sector experienced a decrease in the proportion of AI job postings in 2023 compared to 2022, except for public administration and educational services,\" the report found. Those drops were likely related to leading employers in the US, such as Amazon, Deloitte, Capital One, and others tapering off their overall job postings in the area.\n\nMedicine\n\nAI's application in the medical field is among its most promising applications.\n\nLast year saw the launch of programs like EVEscape, which uses AI to aid in predicting pandemics, and AlphaMissense, which can classify gene mutations more easily using the technology.\n\nAI bots have also gotten better at pretending to be doctors.\n\nGPT-4 Medprompt, reached an accuracy rate of 90.2% last year when responding to medical and diagnosis questions. For example, presented with the case of a long-distance runner with side pain, the specialized version GPT-4 was able to correctly diagnose which muscles could be injured based on the symptoms.\n\nThe federal government is also approving an increasing number of AI-incorporating medical devices.\n\nAs of October 2023 however, the US Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve any devices using generative AI, or that are powered by chatbots, for clinical use.\n\nThe public\n\nNone of that amounts to the public trusting AI very much.\n\nThe report noted a recent Ipsos survey showing that during 2023 more than half of people expressed concern about AI products and services, up 13% from 2022. About a third of respondents said they felt AI would improve their job, with a little less than a quarter of people saying it would make their job worse and the remainder unsure or figuring it wouldn't make much difference.\n\nAbout a third of people said the technology would be a boon to the economy, while more than a third said they thought it would make the economic situation in their country worse.\n\nIn the US, data from the Pew Research Center showed just over half of people report feeling more concerned than excited about AI, up from 38% in 2022.\n\nPolling also showed differences along demographic lines. Wealthier and more educated people were more optimistic about AI's positive potential than lower-income and less-educated people.\n\nDespite that, ChatGPT is widely used. An international survey from the University of Toronto found 63% of those surveyed were aware of the chatbot, with around half saying they used it at least once a week. – San Francisco Chronicle/Tribune News Service",

Though the market's rally has broadened this year, megacap stocks remain a portfolio staple, with fund managers in the latest BofA Global Research survey once again naming them the market's \"most crowded\" trade.Many believe their results could be especially important to markets this time around. The S&P 500 has slid in recent weeks, roughly halving its year-to-date gain to 5% as stickier-than-expected inflation erodes the prospects for the Federal Reserve to cut rates this year.Additionally, the monthslong rally in stocks has made the index expensive relative to history at a time when rising Treasury yields are pressuring equity valuations. Disappointing earnings from the market's heavyweights could give investors less reason to hold stocks.\"Psychologically, the companies coming in at or above expectations is important,\" said David Katz, chief investment officer with Matrix Asset Advisors. \"There's a lot of good news built into a lot of these companies.\"Investors will also focus on next Friday's release of the monthly Personal Consumption Expenditures Price index, a crucial piece of inflation data before the Fed's April 30-May 1 meeting.

Tesla, which reports results on Tuesday, has seen its shares tumble about 40% in 2024 amid concerns about its electric vehicle business.Meta Platforms, whose shares have jumped over 40% in 2024, is due on Wednesday, while Alphabet and Microsoft, which are logging year-to-date gains of about 12% and 7.5% respectively, are set for Thursday.Of the other megacaps, Apple and Amazon are set to report the following week, while Nvidia, whose shares have soared 70% this year on optimism over its artificial intelligence chips, reports on May 22.Six of the seven, excluding Tesla, are expected to post collective earnings growth of 42.1% in the first quarter, UBS strategists said on April 8.\"It appears that the expectations are that they're really going to deliver again,\" said Patrick Kaser, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global. \"And so the risk to me is skewed to the downside.\"Excluding the Magnificent 7, S&P 500 earnings have been negative on a year-over-year basis over the prior four quarters, according to JPMorgan analysts, underlining the group's importance to the market.Beyond the megacaps, over 300 S&P 500 companies expected to report over the coming two weeks. Earnings are expected to rise 9% for the full year, according to LSEG data, with added pressure on the results to support overall valuations.The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio has moderated somewhat this month but is still at 20 times, well above its long-term average of 15.7, according to LSEG Datastream.\"In an environment where there is a lot of uncertainty about Fed rate policy, there's a lot of geopolitical tensions rising, if companies aren't really pushing the pedal on giving positive outlooks for growth ... that could be the factor that weighs on stocks,\" said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Aurora Ellis)",

        "text": "Face the Critic: Ian Betteridge Edition\n\nIan Betteridge, quoting yours truly on non-consensual tracking back in 2020 and then my piece yesterday on the EDPB issuing an opinion against Meta’s “Pay or OK” model in the EU:\n\nI wonder what happened to turn John’s attitude from “no action Apple can take against the tracking industry is too strong” to defending Facebook’s “right” to choose how it invades people’s privacy? Or is he suggesting that a private company is entitled to defend people’s privacy, but governments are not?\n\nI’ve seen a bit of pushback along this line recently, more or less asking: How come I was against Meta’s tracking but now seem for it? I don’t see any contradiction or change in my position though. The only thing I’d change in the 2020 piece Betteridge quotes is this sentence, which Betteridge emphasizes: “No action Apple can take against the tracking industry is too strong.” I should have inserted an adjective before “tracking” — it’s non-consensual tracking I object to, especially tracking that’s downright surreptitious. Not tracking in and of itself.\n\nThat’s why I remain a staunch supporter of Apple’s App Tracking Transparency, and consider it a success. Apple didn’t ban the use of the IDFA for cross-app tracking, and they were correct not to. They simply now require consent. If I had believed that all tracking was ipso facto wrong, I’d have been opposed to ATT on the grounds that it offers the “Allow” choice.\n\nAlso from 2020, I quoted Steve Jobs on privacy:\n\nPrivacy means people know what they’re signing up for, in plain English, and repeatedly. That’s what it means. I’m an optimist, I believe people are smart. And some people want to share more data than other people do. Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them. Let them know precisely what you’re going to do with their data.\n\nThat’s what ATT does. And that’s what’s Meta’s “Pay or OK” model in the EU does. It offers users a clear fair choice: Use Facebook and Instagram free of charge with targeted ads, or pay a reasonable monthly fee for an ad-free experience. No less than Margrethe Vestager herself, back in 2018, was keen on this idea:\n\nMy concern is more about whether we get the right choices. I would like to have a Facebook in which I pay a fee each month, but I would have no tracking and advertising and the full benefits of privacy. It is a provoking thought after all the Facebook scandal. This market is not being explored.\n\nNow Meta is “exploring” that market, but the European Commission doesn’t like the results, because it turns out that when given the clear choice, the overwhelming majority of EU denizens prefer to use Meta’s platforms free-of-charge with targeted ads.\n\nThe best aspects of the EU’s digital privacy laws are those that give people the right to know what data is being collected, where it’s being stored, who it’s being shared with, etc. That’s all fantastic. But the worst aspect is the paternalism. The EU is correct to require that users be required to provide consent before being tracked across properties. And Apple is correct for protecting unique device IDFA identifiers behind a mandatory “Ask App Not to Track / Allow” consent alert. But Jobs was right too: people are smart, and they can — and should be allowed to — make their own decisions. And many people are more comfortable with sharing data than others. The privacy zealots leading this crusade in the EU do not think people are smart, and do not think they should be trusted to make these decisions for themselves.\n\nI don’t like Meta as a company. If a corporation can be smarmy, Meta is that. And they’ve done a lot of creepy stuff over the years, and for a long while clearly acted as though they were entitled to track whatever they could get away with technically. I suspect they thought that if they asked for consent, or made clear what and how they tracked, that users would revolt. But it turns out billions of people who enjoy Meta’s platforms are fine with the deal.\n\nIt’s obviously the case that for some people, Meta’s past transgressions are unforgivable. That’s each person’s decision to make for themselves. Me, I believe in mercy. Again, I still don’t really like the company, by and large. But Threads is pretty good. And sometimes, when I occasionally check in, Instagram can still make me smile. It’s very clear what I’m sharing with Meta when I use those apps, and I’m fine with that. If you’re not, don’t use them. (I’ve still never created a Facebook blue app account, and still feel like I haven’t missed out on a damn thing.)\n\nTo sum up my stance: Tracking is wrong when it’s done without consent, and when users have no idea what’s being tracked or how it’s being used. Tracking is fine when it’s done with consent, and users know what’s being tracked and how it’s being used. Privacy doesn’t mean never being tracked. It means never being tracked without clear consent. I think Meta is now largely, if not entirely, on the right side of this.\n\nIt’s paternalistic — infantilizing even — to believe that government bureaucrats should take these decisions out of the hands of EU citizens. Me, I trust people to decide for themselves. The current European Commission regime is clearly of the belief that all tracking is wrong, regardless of consent. That’s a radical belief that is not representative of the public. The government’s proper role is to ensure people can make an informed choice, and that they have control over their own data. That’s what I thought four years ago, and it’s what I think now.",

        "title": "How Big Tech Is Consuming America’s Electricity and Water",
        "text": "Skip to comments.\n\nHow Big Tech Is Consuming America’s Electricity and Water\n\nEpoch Times ^ | April 18, 2024 | Kevin Stocklin\n\nPosted on by george76\n\nAs federal net-zero policies attempt to shift transportation, heating, and other essentials onto the electric grid, one of the hottest growth sectors of America’s economy is poised to increase electricity demand exponentially, further straining an energy infrastructure that is being pushed into the red.\n\nData centers, the so-called “brains of the internet,” are industrial warehouses packed with rows upon rows of servers. They process, communicate, and store the data behind everything from bank records, online retailers, and social media platforms to Netflix shows and your personal iPhone videos.\n\n“Data centers are essential to cloud computing and its ability to give users remote access to data,” a 2023 Federal Reserve report states, quoting a Science article that calls them the “information backbone of an increasingly digitalized world.”\n\nMany analysts laud data centers as one of the fastest-growing sectors of the real estate market, but the industry may soon find itself hitting a wall as local communities put up increasing resistance to the industry’s seemingly insatiable appetite for power and water.\n\n“While other commercial real estate sectors are experiencing a decline in construction pipelines, data center development has reached an all-time high,” according to a January report by Newmark, a commercial real estate advisory.\n\n“However, growth is increasingly constrained by land and power availability, supply chain challenges and construction delays, not to mention increasing resistance from some local jurisdictions.”\n\nThe report said the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies is fueling the demand.\n\nThe industry is led by cloud computing behemoths like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Meta. It also includes digital landlords, called co-location companies, which rent storage space out to third parties. These include Equinix, Digital Realty, and CyrusOne.\n\nElectricity Demand From Data to Double by 2030..\n\nData warehouses consumed 17 gigawatts of electricity in 2022, or about 4 percent of total U.S. consumption. This is projected to double to 35 gigawatts by 2030.\n\nEric Woodell, who holds a doctorate of science in information systems and communications and is the founder of Amerruss, a tech infrastructure management company, referred to data centers as “energy hogs.”\n\n“But now your data center for AI applications is no longer a hog, it’s an elephant and it’s living in your backyard,” he told The Epoch Times.\n\nMr. Woodell has been managing data centers for 25 years, formerly for Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager.\n\nA mere 10-foot-square space within the average data center consumes about 10 times as much electricity as the average home,\n\n...\n\n“While conventional data centers are already pulling an enormous amount of power, AI computing doesn’t use CPUs [central processing units], but GPU-based systems instead, as the GPUs [graphics processing units] are tailored to better handle complex mathematical functions,” he said. “But there’s a catch: they draw between five and 10 times more power than similarly equipped CPU systems.”\n\nThis hefty increase in electricity demand strains a grid that is already predicted to feature power shortages and routine rolling blackouts in the coming years. This is due to more demands being placed on the grid at a time when utilities are aggressively shutting down coal and gas plants in their transition to wind and solar energy.\n\nAccording to a February case study of one large regional electric utility, PJM, by Quanta Technologies, the next several years will feature “equipment overloads that trigger as much as 6,826 MW of load shedding during average winter peak demand.”\n\nLoad shedding means cutting power to consumers, also known as blackouts, to prevent a system collapse.\n\n...\n\nPJM forecasts new data center load growth of 7,500 MW by 2028, while deactivating 11,100 MW of fossil fuel production, leaving an 18.6 Gigawatt gap between new demand and remaining supply in this sector, according to Mr. Woodell.\n\n“18.6 Gigawatts would power roughly 3 million homes or New York City three times over,” he stated. “The ramifications are massive.”\n\nData Center Alley..\n\nGlobally, data centers consume about 3 percent of the world’s electricity, according to Ryan Yonk, an economist at the American Institute for Economic Research. This consumption tends to be steady and predictable, and utilities can expand to accommodate it, he said.\n\nHowever, problems arise when centers become concentrated in a single area, especially if that area is transitioning away from fossil fuels.\n\n...\n\nThe problem for local communities is that, once a municipality approves the development, the electric utility must build new power generation and transmission lines to service that development. The cost of this new infrastructure is largely borne by the community in the form of higher electric bills for all ratepayers.\n\n“When we pay our electric bills each month, you’re giving a huge subsidy to multibillion-dollar companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple,” the PEC report states.\n\nAs a result, data centers are increasingly facing local resistance when they try to build new facilities.\n\n...\n\nSearching for New Places to Build..\n\nConsequently, developers have started looking elsewhere in search of land, cheap energy, and abundant groundwater. Target locations include Atlanta, Georgia, and Columbus, Ohio. Cheyenne, Wyoming has also approved significant data center development.\n\nData center developers are also seeking locations abroad. The BBC reported in June of 2023 that data centers used about one-fifth of all electricity in the Republic of Ireland, the equivalent of the electricity used in all the country’s urban districts combined.\n\nEnergy consumption in Ireland by these data warehouses increased 31 percent from 2021 to 2022, and by 400 percent since 2015\n\n...\n\nIn Europe and in the UK they’ve basically put moratoriums in place on any new data center builds because there’s just not enough power.”\n\nAnd the drain on local resources goes beyond electricity, it includes water usage as well.\n\nData centers concentrate a significant amount of power in a small space, generating more heat than air cooling alone can mitigate. Consequently, they consume enormous amounts of groundwater to keep the servers from overheating.\n\n...\n\nGoogle, for example, reported that it consumed 5.6 billion gallons of water in 2022, primarily to cool its data centers. This was a 20 percent increase over what it used in 2021.\n\nThe Fed report stated that the data center industry ranked among the 10 largest industries for water consumption in 2021.\n\n...\n\nTypically, he said, on top of the electricity used to power the computers, an additional 40 percent on average is required to cool them. This puts an additional strain on electric grids and consumes enormous volumes of local groundwater in the process.\n\nCan Data Centers Thrive Under the Sea?\n\nCompanies like Microsoft, Subsea Cloud, and some Chinese competitors believe that they have found a solution: sink data centers offshore inside deep-water pods.\n\nThese companies have developed new technologies that can house data centers in coastal waters, thousands of feet below the surface.\n\n...\n\nThe normal operating temperature of a computer chip is above 70 degrees Celsius (158 degrees Fahrenheit), so that even in tropical waters “you still have a difference between the water and the chip that’s so big, it will transfer this heat away from the chips without spending any energy to do it,” Mr. Williams said.\n\nHowever, where Microsoft has constructed data tanks with five-inch thick steel walls to keep deep-sea pressure from crushing the tanks, Subsea Cloud fills its tanks with a patented non-corrosive fluid, using solid-state drives that can function in a liquid environment. This serves two functions.\n\n...\n\n“Number one, it’s transferring the heat very efficiently,” Mr. Williams said. “Number two, it’s maintaining a pressure inside of the pod that is equal to the outside.” This requires the walls of the undersea pods to be only one-quarter of an inch thick.\n\nWhile it took some convincing to get tech companies to consider an underwater alternative, the demand for undersea pods is “huge at the moment,” he said.\n\n“We are very lucky to be in a spot where very large companies are talking to us—and governments, too. The fact is that it doesn’t look like the world population wants to scale back on the use of electronics and AI and all of that.”\n\nSubmersible data pods may help to reduce the land, electricity, and groundwater required to feed the growing demand from data centers, but ultimately the global data industry will still need vast amounts of power to fuel its growth, which will continue to strain power grids.\n\nMr. Woodell says that one day soon, the tech industry will have to either innovate dramatic new efficiencies in data processing or face practical and regulatory roadblocks to further growth.\n\n\n\nTOPICS:\n\nBusiness/Economy\n\nNews/Current Events\n\nPolitics/Elections\n\nKEYWORDS:\n\nbigtech\n\nelectricgrid\n\nelectricity\n\nenergy\n\ninfrastructure\n\nnetzero\n\nwater\n\nClick here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo: george76\n\nBookmark\n\n\n\nby 2 posted onby Southside_Chicago_Republican (God save the United States!)\n\nTo: george76\n\nSaid another way windmills and solar panels won’t do the job.

There are also several other bonuses and perks, which we’ve listed out below.\n\nHow do I catch a shiny Bellsprout in Pokémon Go?\n\nAs per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via Wayback Machine), Shiny rates on Community Days are about 1 in 24, which means that if you keep playing throughout the three-hour window, you should find quite a few shiny Pokémon.\n\nIf you’re short on time or Poké Balls, you can pop an Incense, then quickly tap each Bellsprout to check for shiny ones, running from any that aren’t shiny. Notably, any Bellsprout you’ve already tapped will face where your player is standing, so that should help identify which ones you may have already checked.\n\nWhat Community Day move does Bellsprout’s evolution learn?\n\nIf you evolve Weepinbell into Victreebel from 2 p.m. until 10 p.m. in your local time, it will learn the fast move Magical Leaf.\n\nIf you miss out on evolving it during this period, you will likely be able to evolve it during a Community Day weekend event in December to get Magical Leaf. If you don’t want to wait, you can use an Elite TM to get the move.\n\nHow does Victreebel do in the Pokémon Go meta?\n\nYou can use Victreebel in raids and gyms with Magical Leaf and Leaf Blade, but know that it is at the bottom rung when it comes to grass-type attackers. It’s usable and fine, but it gets outclassed by many things, like Kartana and every grass-type starter Pokémon. Victreebel may be better as a poison-type attacker, even more so when it’s a Shadow Victreebel, but it still falls behind popular picks like Roserade or Mega Beedrill.\n\nPvP expert JRE47 says that Magical Leaf is an improvement for Victreebel in PvP, giving it an edge against common opponents, especially if it’s a Shadow Victreebel.\n\nHow do I make the most of Bellsprout Community Day?\n\nThe following bonuses will be active during Bellsprout Community Day:\n\nTripled Stardust for catching Pokémon\n\nDoubled candy for catching Pokémon\n\nDoubled chance for level 31+ trainers to get XL candy from catching Pokémon\n\nIncense lasts three hours\n\nLure Modules lasts three hours\n\nBellsprout special photobombs when taking snapshots\n\nOne additional special trade\n\nStardust cost halved for trading\n\nThat said, you should definitely pop a Star Piece and an Incense and try to nab some powerful Bellsprout.\n\nIf you can Mega Evolve Venusaur, Beedrill, Gengar, Sceptile, Groudon, or Abomasnow, you’ll score additional Bellsprout Candy per catch.\n\nIn addition to all this, Niantic is still running special four-star raids from 5-10 p.m., where if you clear the Weepinbell raid, Bellsprout will spawn in a 300-meter radius around the gym for 30 minutes. These raids cannot be done remotely. If the usual 2-5 p.m. spawn increase doesn’t get you the Bellsprout you wanted, you can try raiding for another chance.",

What an intriguing question! Let's dive into some nuclear physics and math to estimate the potential destruction. **Uranium stockpile:** According to various sources, including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), there are approximately: 1. 635 metric tons of uranium-235 (enriched) in the world's nuclear arsenals. 2. 3.5 million metric tons of natural uranium (containing ~0.7% U-235) stored as spent fuel, waste, and other forms. ...\n\nLlama 2\n\n>>> If we take all the uraniumin the world and make the biggest nuclear bomb possible, how destructive would it be?

        "text": "KEY\n\nTAKEAWAYS The possibility of only one interest rate cut and escalation of geopolitical tensions increases uncertainty levels for investors\n\nThe 100-day simple moving average could be the S&P 500's next support level\n\nMassive selloff in Tech stocks sends the Nasdaq Composite below its 100-day moving average\n\nWhat a difference a week makes.\n\nLast week, the stock market changed its tune from up, up, up,... to up, down, up, down. That made it feel like investors were uncertain, yet the CBOE Volatility Index ($VIX) wasn't high enough to confirm the fear. This week, the market's singing another tune emphasizing the word \"down.\" This week, the selling pressure was more dominant, especially in the Tech sector. Does this mean the bear is coming out of hibernation?\n\nThe Macro Environment\n\nWe heard comments from two Federal Reserve Presidents, John Williams and Austan Goolsbee, who left open the possibility of a rate hike. Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested interest rates could remain higher for longer. Next week, we'll get the March PCE data, and, in light of the Fed comments, it could be higher than estimates.\n\nWe'll also get the Q1 GDP, which will probably reveal the continued strength of the US economy. If the economy continues to be resilient, we may not see a rate cut this year. As of now, the stock market has priced in at least one rate cut in 2024, which is different than the four that were expected earlier in the year.\n\nIn a \"higher for longer\" interest rate environment, two events that could have intensified the selling pressure at the end of the week are:\n\nEscalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which, for the time being, have tapered.\n\nOptions expiration day, which means heavy trading volume.\n\nNobody wants to open new positions on a Friday, especially after a volatile trading week. Anything could happen over the weekend, and traders would rather be patient and wait to see if the stock market has further to fall before jumping in.\n\nThe Broader Market\n\nYou've heard the adage, \"Markets take the stairs up and the elevator down.\" You can see this play out in the charts of the broader indexes.\n\nThe S&P 500\n\nThe S&P 500 ($SPX) closed below 5,000, a significant psychological level. On the daily chart, the index broke below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and is now approaching its 100-day SMA. The last six days have been an elevator ride down and, the way the chart looks, there could be more selling next week.\n\nFIGURE 1. DAILY CHART OF THE S&P 500. Since the S&P 500 fell below its 50-day SMA, it's taken the elevator down. The index is now approaching its 100-day SMA, which could be its next support level. Will it fall below the support?Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.\n\nOn the weekly chart, the S&P 500 is above its 50-week SMA, but has three consecutive down weeks, which doesn't paint a pretty picture. Right now, it looks as if the index has further to fall.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average\n\nAfter its most recent selloff, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($INDU) is trading around a support level (December 2023 high). The daily chart below shows that even though the index closed higher on Friday, it hit resistance from its 100-day SMA.\n\nFIGURE 2. DAILY CHART OF DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ($INDU). After its elevator ride down, $INDU appears to have hit a support level and trying to reverse, which is a positive sign.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite\n\nThe Technology sector was hit hard this week. NVIDIA (NVDA) fell over 9% on Friday; Tesla (TSLA) shares continued to fall, hitting a new 52-week low; and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell over 5%.\n\nSuper Micro Computers (SMCI), which has been in the top 5 StockCharts Technical Rank (SCTR) for months, fell over 23%. The selloff was caused by the company's decision not to preannounce its earnings results as it has in the past.\n\nLooks like investors were taking their Tech stock profits. As a result of the big Tech selloff, the Nasdaq Composite is trading below its 100-day SMA (see chart below).\n\nFIGURE 3. DAILY CHART OF NASDAQ COMPOSITE. After falling below its 100-day SMA, the Nasdaq Composite could slide to its 200-day SMA. The small wick at the bottom is slightly encouraging, but next week is another week.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.\n\nWhenever there's a massive selloff, as was the case this week, investors question whether the market has hit a bottom and if it's an ideal time to open long positions. There was a little bit of that on Friday, but every time the market rallied, it met pressure from sellers and the rally fizzled. When technicals still point lower, you may want to adopt a \"wait and see\" approach before entering long positions.\n\nNobody knows what will happen next week, but tech companies will start reporting earnings, and that could lift the stock market.\n\nSome Bright Spots\n\nAfter experiencing a plunge similar to that of the broader indexes, the Financial sector is showing signs of a reversal. The daily chart of the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) below shows a possible reversal, although a series of higher highs and higher lows is needed before an uptrend can be established. XLF would need to break above.\n\nFIGURE 4. DAILY CHART OF FINANCIAL SELECT SECTOR SPDR ETF (XLF). Looks like XLF will have to overcome the resistance from its 50-day moving average before its trend reverses.Chart source: StockCharts.com. For educational purposes.\n\nShares of Bank of America (BAC), JP Morgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) all traded higher on Friday. WFC's stock price reached a new all-time high. Precious metals, such as gold and silver, are trading higher. As geopolitical tensions arise, investors turn to these safe-haven investments.\n\nIt was interesting to see the CBOE Volatility Index ($VIX) hit a high of 21.36, close to the 23 level it hit in October last year. But it pulled back and closed at 18.71. The higher volatility could have been because of options expiration.\n\nIf you look at the chart of the Nasdaq Composite, you'll see that this coincided with the October selloff in Tech stocks. Will the broader markets follow a similar path, given Tech earnings start next week? We'll have to wait and see.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis week's stock market action wasn't great, and while it's tempting to find bargains in stocks, it's best to exercise patience. Instead of chasing positions, it's an excellent time to analyze charts and observe the market's actions. This can go a long way in understanding the irrational nature of the stock market.\n\nEnd-of-Week Wrap-Up\n\nS&P 500 closes down 0.88% at 4,967.23, Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.56% at 37,986; Nasdaq Composite down 2.05% at 15,282.01\n\n$VIX up 3.94% at 18.71\n\nBest performing sector for the week: Utilities\n\nWorst performing sector for the week: Technology\n\nTop 5 Large Cap SCTR stocks: MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR); Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN); Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI); Vistra Energy Corp. (VST); Vertiv Holdings (VRT)\n\nOn the Radar Next Week\n\nQ1 2024 US GDP\n\nMarch Core PCE\n\nMarch Durable Goods Orders\n\nEarnings season is in full swing with Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Intel Corp. (INTC), and Visa (V) reporting.\n\nDisclaimer: This blog is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

Cramer said analysts largely agree that Meta will report rosy numbers, which means CEO Mark Zuckerberg, unlike Tesla CEO Elon Musk, will not have to pull a rabbit out of a hat.\n\nOn Thursday, Caterpillar , Merck and the tech giants Microsoft and Alphabet will release earnings.

        "text": "Mahmoud Itani / Android Authority\n\nAndroid Apps Weekly: New apps and games Looking for some new Android apps and Android games to keep you occupied? This week we highlight two new apps, as well as three games that are worth a closer look.\n\nFocus Go Price: Free with in-app purchases\n\nRita El Khoury / Android Authority\n\nWhile there are tons of new games released every single week, app launches tend to occur at a much slower rate. The good news is that Focus Go is one of the best new apps we’ve added to this list in a while. If you’re looking for an alternative to Google Photos, Focus Go makes for a perfect choice, emphasizing simplicity in finding and organizing photos. There are a few extras here, but that’s the point. The user interface is highly intuitive, and the app operates quickly. Best of all, it’s ad-free, although there are optional in-app purchases. You can learn even more about the app in our Focus Go hands-on.\n\nTikTok Notes Price: Free\n\nMahmoud Itani / Android Authority\n\nTikTok holds a somewhat controversial status in the US, as the government seeks to ban the app. However, this hasn’t hindered the China-based company from expanding its reach with the new TikTok Notes app, currently available in select countries including Canada. Unfortunately, the US isn’t among these regions. Nevertheless, it’s still worthwhile to highlight the app this week. The Notes app operates similarly to Instagram, emphasizing photo sharing. What’s great is that there’s no need to create a new login; you can simply use your existing TikTok credentials.\n\nTokyo Debunker Price: Free with in-app purchases\n\nTokyo Debunker is a husbando anime style game set a Darkwick Academy, a school made up of students that have would their souls to devil for a special wish. Now you’ll have to work with them to solve supernatural cases all over Tokyo. In the 20-30 minutes I spent playing this one it seems to have a decent enough story, graphics, and gameplay but beware there are lots of in-app purchases and other aspects that can make this one feel a bit like a cash grab at times. If you’ve played similar titles, this one might be worth checking out, but don’t expect any major changes to the typical formula here.\n\nPilgrims Price: Free with in-app purchases\n\nPilgrim has been around through Steam, console, and iOS for years, but now Amanita Design is bringing the experience to Android. While the game is free to install, it’s more of a limited trial unless you pay a one-time unlock fee of $2.99. This is actually a great deal, considering this is essentially the same version that other platforms are charging $6.99 for.\n\nRed Desert: team RPG Price: Free with in-app purchases\n\nRed Desert is a team RPG set across vast deserts where you must battle a constant onslaught of enemies as you level up your characters. There’s a basic story here but the focus is definitely on multiplayer aspects like PVP. Be aware this is also an IDLE RPG, which is a nice way of saying that you can make changes to what is going on in the game, but if you don’t the game will take care of the action itself and keep your character alive. This makes for a much more casual experience, but also one that’s better suited for the distractions that are commonplace when using a mobile device.\n\nComments",

The new integration allows you to message users on Slack and Teams without having to switch between apps.\n\nThere's a catch, though. The feature is available only to paying subscribers and the functionality itself isn't exactly new. It's just out of beta now. Only a handful of users had access to the said feature, but it's now available to all paying users.\n\nUnfortunately, it requires a bit of setup. You have to download and set up another app called Mio, which acts as a bridge between Google Chats and Slack/Teams. Mio also requires you to buy an additional license. The good news is that Mio supports all features, such as tagging, sending files, GIFs, etc. and will work across different messaging apps. Additionally, Mio makes sure Google Workspace and Microsoft Office 365 play nice together.\n\nSource",

        "text": "This is a routine jawboning case. Facebook and Twitter allegedly shut down Hart’s accounts for disseminating COVID misinformation. Hart claims he was targeted by the government. The district court dismissed the case (1, 2).\n\nThe Ninth Circuit affirms in a brief memo opinion. The court says simply: “As private companies, Twitter and Facebook are not subject to the Constitution’s constraints.” (Cite to O’Handley). Hart alleged Twitter and Facebook engaged in joint actions with the government. However, “Facebook and Twitter’s rights to moderate his posts arise from their user agreements with Hart, not from any right conferred by the federal government….Hart has not shown that the Federal Defendants are responsible for Facebook and Twitter’s moderation of his posts.” Hart cited 10 interactions between the government and the services, but none of them referenced him, and the interactions showed the “the federal officials sought to inform Facebook and Twitter of what the government considered to be misinformation about COVID-19.”\n\nAs I said, standard jawboning stuff. There are only three mild points of interest in this ruling.\n\nFirst, Judge Rawlinson concurred only in the result but did not explain her differences with the opinion. I’m not sure what that’s about.\n\nSecond, in the next couple of months, the Supreme Court will issue an opinion in the Murthy jawboning case, which could change the rules for this and other cases. The court proceeded anyway: “We agree with the parties that we need not stay consideration of this appeal pending the Supreme Court’s decision in Murthy.” From my perspective, the panel didn’t see any reason to wait because Hart’s case was so weak that they probably couldn’t imagine any way the Supreme Court ruling could make it meritorious.\n\nThird, this is at least the SIXTH time in the past 18 months that the Ninth Circuit has rejected an online jawboning case. (The five others: O’Handley, Huber, Doe v. Google, Kennedy v. Warren, Rogalinski). It’s a reminder of the stakes in the Murthy case. Today, online jawboning cases are easy dismissals (except in the Fifth Circuit, which has tacitly declared judicial independence from the union). However, if the Supreme Court’s Murthy opinion gives any hope to plaintiffs, the resulting litigation tsunami will be enormous.\n\nCase Citation: Hart v. Facebook, Inc., 2024 WL 1693355 (9th Cir.

Manage cookie settings\n\nThat said, given we've seen several iterations of Sunderland since the game was first announced – even before it was announced, actually – it's hard to say if this is definitive proof of a change of direction or just a pre-existing asset.\n\nThe facial model of the James we see in just the reveal teaser alone feels a tad inconsistent, with his face, hair, and hair colour changing several times throughout the course of the three-minute trailer.\n\nHas Silent Hill 2 Remake's James had a facelift? | Image credit: SteamDB / Eurogamer\n\nIn fact, the James face we see at 1m49s looks much more in keeping with the James we see in the icon above, so it's hard to know if this asset signifies an artistic change or not.\n\nEither way, though, going on comments on social media, most fans seem happy with the revised version. Here's hoping we'll see more of Silent Hill 2 Remake – and James' face – at the next PlayStation State of Play event.\n\nSilent Hill 2 – one of gaming's worst-kept secrets before it was formally revealed back in October 2022 – has been rated in Korea. It was given a mature rating due to, as translated by Google, \"excessive violence, excessive blood from hitting and being hit (and there is physical damage such as creatures being separated)\", and excessive depictions that some may find fearful and/or disgusting, including \"creatures with strangely formed limbs\" – a Silent Hill staple, of course.\n\nWe can only hope Silent Hill 2 doesn't follow the same pattern as Silent Hill: The Short Message. That similarly first popped up on the Korean ratings board, although it took two years for that game to move from rating to release.",

        "text": "April 22, 2024, is Earth Day. Originally a day to promote awareness of the ways plastics wreck the environment, Earth Day has more recently become a time when all environmental causes are spotlighted because we only have one planet to live on, and it makes sense to try and keep it habitable.\n\nEarth Day is also the time of year when tech companies like to remind us of their commitment to making and selling \"sustainable\" products. However, it seems like they don't understand what that means; sustainable tech is the 21st-century version of the light cigarette. It's still really bad, but not as bad as it could be.\n\nAndroid & Chill (Image credit: Future) One of the web's longest-running tech columns, Android & Chill is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.\n\nI'm not implying that companies shouldn't try to be more environmentally conscious or that every little bit isn't helpful. They should, and it does. I'm talking about the amount of praise companies heap upon themselves for doing the bare minimum and then selling it as something more significant than it is. In other words, they're not really lying, but they're basically lying.\n\nIt's impossible to build a truly sustainable tech product like a smartphone and sell it at a profit.\n\nYou keep using that word ...\n\n(Image credit: imgflip)\n\nSustainable is a strong word that means a few different things. If you look at the definition, you'll see that sustainable means \"able to continue at the same level for a period of time,\" but you'll notice there's a lot more to it than that. Sustainability in manufacturing is defined as \"using methods that do not harm the environment so that natural resources are still available in the future.\"\n\nThis can be true for some parts and assemblies used in tech products like new phones. Copper and aluminum are almost infinitely recyclable, and 100% of the metals used to make phones, tablets, and other products could come from reclaimed material. Plastic is the same way, though it's not a true natural resource.\n\nTwo other important materials used inside the products we love to buy usually get left out of the conversation: cobalt and lithium. Both are materials used in batteries, and until a better way to store energy is developed, both are necessary.\n\nBe an expert in 5 minutes Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe thing is, both these materials are also 100% recyclable, and a battery built from completely recycled material is a real thing. No tech companies are even discussing this, though Apple does want to use recycled cobalt within the next few years.\n\nUntil this happens and the new products we buy are built from parts and pieces of the old products we've sent to be recycled, tech products are not sustainable. It doesn't matter how often or how loud company executives try to claim otherwise.\n\nEvery little bit does help\n\n(Image credit: Samsung)\n\nNone of this discounts the effort companies are making when it comes to being more environmentally friendly. Overselling what's being done and using buzzwords that aren't true doesn't mean things aren't much better than they used to be.\n\nSamsung, Apple, HP, Acer, and almost every other company producing consumer electronics are making efforts to use more recycled materials. Just because we haven't reached the point where no newly mined metals and newly produced plastic are being used in construction doesn't negate the real progress being made.\n\nThe actual issue is both simple and complex. It's also the same issue that drives every other decision made by the companies in question: money. Tech companies are businesses and only exist to make a profit for their shareholders. This is why Google kills products and services that aren't making money. This is why phones no longer have a simple 3.5mm headphone jack. It's also why no company makes a phone built using 100% recycled materials.\n\nMoney-saving decisions can be helpful, too. The real reason your new phone doesn't come with a charger in the box is that it makes the packaging smaller. Smaller boxes mean more fit on a pallet which means more fit into a truck or shipping container. Besides saving big on shipping costs, there's no longer a small piece of e-waste inside every new phone box. Win-win.\n\nWhen you get into it though, there is no way a company like Apple or Samsung could afford to be more like Fairphone. It would eat into the bottom line far to deeply.\n\n(Image credit: Fairphone)\n\nNo company builds a product that's as ethically sourced and environmentally friendly as Fairphone, and no company even wants to try.\n\nIt's not hard to figure out why. Fairphone isn't making money. The company only posted profits of €44,000 ($47,000) for 2022 and has very little money in reserve. In contrast, Apple made $170.782 billion and Samsung made $31.5 billion. Billion.\n\nIf you want to make a phone like the Fairphone 5, you're not able to make as many of them and will not make as much profit per unit. For Apple and Samsung shareholders, this isn't \"sustainable,\" so the products these companies sell aren't as \"sustainable.\"\n\nNothing will make the Apple's and Samsung's of the world change before they have to change. Both companies will continue to source raw materials by any means and try to seduce consumers with environmentally friendly measures in areas that don't cut into the bottom line too deeply until the world runs out of those materials.\n\nYou should do your part by recycling tech products and buying used or refurbished items when you can. You should also know that regardless of what they tell you, the companies making consumer tech only care about the environment when it doesn't hurt the bottom line.",

To keep data centers from overheating, companies use water to cool down the hardware.\n\nAccording to China Water Risk, China could triple the number of data centers by 2030, reaching roughly 11 million data center racks that house servers and other equipment.\n\nAnd it's not just China. The AI boom is already leading to an astronomical amount of water being used elsewhere, including in the US. Last year, researchers found that just in training GPT-3 alone, OpenAI partner Microsoft consumed a whopping 185,000 gallons of water, which is enough to cool an entire nuclear reactor. Google also admitted in its 2023 Environmental Report that it had used up an astronomical 5.6 billion gallons of water in 2022.\n\nAI chatbots are vastly more energy-intensive than conventional methods of finding information online, relying on specialized chips that consume huge amounts of electricity.\n\nPer China Water Risk's report, if 100 million users were to chat with OpenAI's ChatGPT, it would consume the equivalent of 20 Olympic swimming pools. Doing the same via simple Google searches would only \"consume one swimming pool.\"\n\nAll that usage could have devastating effects on parts of the world where water resources are already extremely scarce. Last month, The Atlantic reported that Microsoft was trying to cover up the water usage of its data center in the Arizona desert.\n\nKeep Cool and Carry On\n\nAnd the AI hype cycle isn't quite over yet. Experts are worried about the further rise of energy and water usage.\n\nArm Holdings Plc CEO Rene Haas told Bloomberg this week that he expects the world's data centers to use more electricity than India, the world's most populous nation, by the end of the decade.\n\n\"We are still incredibly in the early days in terms of the capabilities,\" he said, ringing the alarm bells over AI eclipsing our global energy demands.\n\nTo Haas, one meaningful step forward is to find new ways to train and power these AI models with more energy-efficient chips.\n\n\"There needs to be broad breakthroughs,\" he told Bloomberg. \"Any piece of efficiency matters.\"\n\nMore on AI and water: Microsoft Is Draining Arizona's Water for its AI",

Instead I would opt for a specific version of Fedora 40, namely, Fedora Silverblue 40, also out this month.\n\nA bit of history\n\nIf you’ve only used Linux from around 2012 onward, there’s a good chance you’ve had an easy time installing and setting things up; this is because lots of effort has gone into making installers easy to use and in many cases, third-party software and drivers now get installed out-of-box.\n\nThings haven’t always been this way, however, getting Linux up and running used to be a real chore. This is one of the things Canonical wanted to resolve with Ubuntu, it wanted to make Linux easier for users.\n\nWhen I started using Linux, I started on Ubuntu 8.04 LTS about a month after it came out and it was OK depending on the hardware I chose to install it on. It wasn’t anywhere as near as straightforward as it is nowadays, but it was a big improvement on the state of things prior to Ubuntu’s existence.\n\nThe wallpaper in Ubuntu 8.04 LTS 'Hardy Heron'.\n\nAnother notable event from the past\n\nAs a full-time Linux user, Spring 2008, when I discovered Linux, is something I can quite vividly remember. Another event I remember about 18 months after this was when Google held a keynote introducing ChromeOS and several follow-up videos it released showing off the architecture and the big advancements in security and stability that ChromeOS offered over traditional operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nAs we all know, one of the major issues with ChromeOS is that it’s a web-first system. While this becomes less of an issue as time marches forward, it is still an issue. It seemed like if you needed a fully-fledged desktop, you’d need to stick to a less securely architectured operating system.\n\nA better architecture for full desktops\n\nAlthough I only discovered it much later, the Fedora Project released an “atomic” version of its desktop operating system alongside Fedora 28 in May 2018. Called Fedora Silverblue, this edition of Fedora Workstation is a full, but immutable, operating system.\n\nImmutable doesn’t mean you can’t do anything, of course you can install your programs and transfer your documents, what it refers to is the underlying system; the things you ideally don’t want mucking up.\n\nWith this read-only architecture for the base of the system, it means that you get a more stable system that is less prone to bugs. Atop this rock-solid base, you are strongly encouraged and more or less railroaded into using Flatpak versions of programs meaning they’re all containerized into their own little box separate from the base system boosting your system’s security.\n\nOn top of this, Fedora Silverblue grabs the latest software updates for you almost immediately after you’ve logged into your session; GNOME Software is set up by default to download updates automatically and they’re installed the next time your shut down your computer; this makes sure your software is fresh and less likely to be exploited.\n\nJust some of the programs in GNOME Software.\n\nAs it uses something called OSTree, Fedora Silverblue has a nifty little feature that saves a previous version of your system (before the latest updates), which you can always roll back to if you notice that anything has broken. This snapshotting feature is also useful if you decide to jump between different atomic versions of Fedora, that’s a bit more advanced, but you can read about it in the Fedora Docs (check out the last three paragraphs of the upgrading section).\n\nTo me, the improvements brought about by Fedora Silverblue and the other atomic versions (one for most of the other desktop environments) deliver much of what Google was promising with ChromeOS to the traditional desktop scene. I would also say that the introduction of atomic desktops does for security just what Ubuntu did for ease-of-use 20 years ago.\n\nYour choice this month\n\nThe Fedora Project is lining up the Fedora 40 series for release on April 23 while Canonical is set to release Ubuntu 24.04 LTS on April 25. While there is an argument to choose Ubuntu if you want to stay on one release for many years as opposed to upgrading every 13 months, I think most people would benefit by opting for Fedora Silverblue.\n\nNot only do you get a better security setup, but Fedora also ships with newer software in some cases, such as the GNOME desktop environment. For end users, this option is probably the most ideal, while there is a case for Ubuntu’s fewer changes in business and possibly education settings.\n\nMy experience with Fedora Silverblue\n\nI have only come across Fedora Silverblue relatively recently, but I have to say, when stacked up against other systems like Ubuntu and Linux Mint, it is my favourite. Not only do I appreciate the added security and more punctual update settings, but it has also been pretty pleasant to run on this resource-strangled laptop.\n\nAnother thing I like about Fedora in general is the Fedora Writer tool to get the Silverblue installation media set up. Fedora Writer is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux - it lets you select the version of Fedora you want and which USB stick you want to write it to, it then downloads the OS, verifies it, writes it to the media, and then verifies the installation media to ensure it’s not corrupted.\n\nThe security of obtaining Fedora Silverblue via Fedora Writer plus the implicit security of Fedora Silverblue make it an extremely resilient choice, especially when the number of cyber attacks are ever-increasing. For those who don’t remember, the Linux Mint website was compromised eight years ago and a malicious ISO was replaced by the legitimate one; this incident helped push the need for verifying ISO images, which Fedora Writer does automatically.\n\nA potential drawback of Fedora Silverblue for some users is its reliance on Flatpaks. If you use a lot of desktop applications, you may possibly find a piece of software unavailable. I would recommend checking Flathub to see whether a Flatpak package exists for all the software you need but there is a lot available so most people should be covered.\n\nIf you do find all of your apps in Flathub, the best way to install them after setup is to search for them in the Software utility that comes with Fedora and do a search; everything that’s on Flathub is in Software too.\n\nBased on my usage of Fedora Silverblue 39 over the last few months, my experience has been overwhelmingly positive. I think my biggest gripe (it’s really not that much of an issue) is just after I log in and the system decides to grab available updates. Also, for anyone that uses Firefox, you'll want to install the Flatpak version of Firefox from Mozilla in GNOME Software so that you don't have any issues with video playback on the web, it will also be free of Fedora's customisations to that browser.\n\nThis particular laptop struggles a bit due to the nature of the CPU (1.1Ghz dual core), so when the updates start to download and I’m attempting to open the browser things can get a bit sticky but generally this resolves quickly and the device is fast(ish) again. Most people shouldn’t run into this issue if they’ve bought a decent computer in the last decade.\n\nOne unknown to me is how well a big upgrade of Silverblue will go, I’ll first get to try this when Fedora Silverblue 40 is released later this month. If it’s anything like the updates though, I don’t expect any issues at all.\n\nHere are my laptops specs, in case you were wondering\n\nSeeing as I've mentioned my laptop's hardware, I thought it would be fitting to share more details about the particular laptop I'm using to experience Fedora Silverblue. I have previously run Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and to a limited degree, Windows 10 on it so have seen how each runs on here.\n\nSome of the key specs are as follows:\n\nCPU: Intel® Celeron® N4000 (1.1 GHz) × 2\n\nIntel® Celeron® N4000 (1.1 GHz) × 2 Memory: 4.0 GB\n\n4.0 GB Graphics: Intel® UHD Graphics 600 (GLK 2)\n\nIntel® UHD Graphics 600 (GLK 2) DIsk Space: 500 GB\n\nAs you can see, the RAM should be sufficient for running an operating system and a couple of apps and in fact know that it is sufficient because I've watched the memory manager not even get full while the machine is struggling; it's all down to that underpowered, dual-core, dual thread CPU.\n\nOf all the operating systems, Windows 10 and Ubuntu were definitely the heaviest feeling. If I recall correctly, there was a super irritating bug I ran into with Ubuntu where the whole system would lock up when trying to transfer my data to a back up.\n\nThe Cinnamon edition of Linux Mint was good, better than one of the supposedly lighter spins in fact, but still not as smooth as Fedora Silverblue has been for me.\n\nI'm not too sure if it's GNOME's way of handing things or what, but Fedora Silverblue seems to throttle background apps to enable the maximum performance of the program that is in view. This feels slightly different compared to other operating systems that I've used and it really does benefit this laptop greatly.\n\nThe fact that Fedora Silverblue runs great on my under-powered laptop, highlights that it should be a great choice for most hardware people try to install it on. This fact leads well into the next point I want to discuss.\n\nA solution for computers that don’t support Windows 11\n\nThis editorial has included a good chunk of reminiscing. In the time since I discovered Linux in 2008, many of our computing activities are done online, heck, I’m even writing this article up in Google Docs, a web browser-based office suite. With this trend away from desktop applications, the fact that Linux doesn’t support some Windows programs is not as much of an issue, and, by the way, Linux offers some great alternatives in a lot of cases.\n\nThe analyst firm Canalys reported in December that a massive 240 million PCs could end up in landfills after Windows 10 expires in October 2025 as people upgrade their machines to get Windows 11. Put frankly, this is an environmental disaster seeing as many of these PCs have no issues whatsoever except the fact that they don’t meet some arbitrary requirements.\n\nWith this in mind, I would recommend Fedora Silverblue to anyone who is facing the Windows 10 End of Life dilemma. Even if you do decide to get another machine for Windows 11, at least you’d have a backup computer or you could give it away to friends or family as a hand-me-down in the full knowledge that it’s running a secure operating system.\n\nWhat about Ubuntu?\n\nLook, I like Ubuntu but its core is still much what it was 20 years ago when it came out, overly reliant on deb packages. Canonical has also failed to convince the community of the benefits of snap packages, just as it failed with the Unity desktop. So, I think with Fedora’s more developed atomic desktop and without the politics around snap, Fedora Silverblue 40 stands as the better distribution to choose this April over Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.\n\nHopefully, the Fedora Project pushes on with its atomic desktops and moves to make them the default option and I hope Canonical sits up and pays attention and makes a similar move too. As things stand, Canonical doesn’t offer anything equivalent to Fedora Silverblue for desktop users, which is a shame, I’d like them to move in that direction, or at least have it as an alternative to the main version of Ubuntu.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nUnless something very nasty happens during the upgrade to Fedora Silverblue 40, I have to say that I’m fully sold on Fedora Silverblue. I have used Ubuntu and Linux Mint extensively over the past decade, and for me, neither of them match Silverblue. It finally feels like we have most of the security advantages of ChromeOS with a full desktop experience.\n\nIf you’ve got experience with Fedora Silverblue, I am keen to hear your views about it and whether you’ve had any significant issues, let me know in the comments section. If you’re looking to upgrade or change your computer’s operating system this month, which way are you going to go? Ubuntu, Fedora Silverblue, or a third option?",

        "title": "Comment: Google One VPN may have suffered from a lack of trust",
        "text": "Last week, Google announced that it would soon shut down the VPN service included with Google One. The company pointed to it only being used by a fraction of subscribers, and I wonder if part of that is due to a lack of consumer trust.\n\nIf you’re looking for a bit more privacy while browsing the internet, a VPN is one of the most straightforward solutions. It offers a quick way to prevent your internet provider from seeing your browsing habits, and using a VPN also masks your IP address, making it a bit harder for companies to track you across visits (assuming you properly clear your cookies and such). I’ll also typically use a VPN when connecting to a free public Wi-Fi network.\n\nAround the time that the Google One VPN became widely available, I mentioned it to my only friend who cares enough to use a VPN on a regular basis. His first question to me was “Why should I trust it?”\n\nIt’s a simple enough question. And to the company’s credit, there’s an in-depth explanation – backed by a third-party audit – available as to why the Google One VPN can be trusted with your potentially sensitive browsing. However, this is not something that could be quickly and easily conveyed in a casual conversation with someone who isn’t already familiar with networking principles.\n\nAdmittedly, this is merely an anecdote, but I wonder if there’s a nugget of truth behind it. Were people simply not using the Google One VPN because they weren’t sure they could trust it? After all, the service was bundled with an already-useful $1.99/month subscription, while monthly NordVPN plans start at $12.99 – six times more!\n\nAs the adage goes: if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. A VPN that costs one-sixth of its leading competitor surely must have significant, tangible (privacy/functionality) downsides, right? Google has long tracked individuals’ browsing habits, sometimes even when you don’t expect them to. Even if it’s not true in this case, the perception alone would likely have been damaging.\n\nThat said, the service’s lack of use could be simply explained by a lack of mainstream appeal. The average person likely isn’t concerned with (or aware of) the security and privacy issues that a VPN is designed to fix.\n\nBack on the subject of perception, Google is also currently facing its own reputation for “killing” beloved products (pouring out another one for Stadia). I have no doubt that this reputation kept some people from bothering with Google’s VPN, even if they were already paying for Google One. Worse, by shutting it down, Google is affirming those beliefs – “I’m glad I didn’t switch to Google’s VPN; they’re already shutting it down.”\n\nLet’s think about it another way. If hardly anyone was using the Google One VPN, what reason was there to shut it down? Everyone was continuing to pay the subscription and Google only needed to provide a VPN to the handful of customers who actually used it. It’s not as though Google is shutting down VPN services altogether, as Fi Wireless customers and Pixel owners will continue to have access.\n\nInstead, the company has chosen to worsen its “killer” image by eliminating a feature of Google One. But I digress.\n\nAt the end of the day, I truly wonder how much of the Google One VPN’s failure can be attributed to a lack of trust. If you can’t immediately and completely trust your VPN to not track your browsing and to still exist for the foreseeable future, what’s the point of it?",

        "text": "Dee Bryant jams on the gas as her Mustang rockets forward toward a line of plastic bollards at the Irwindale Speedway. Suddenly, she takes her foot off the gas. The growling car whips around 180 degrees in a perfect arc.\n\nVeteran stuntwoman Bryant is a top driver and a rare Black woman rising through the ranks. She has doubled for Angela Bassett, Kerry Washington, and Regina King, among many others. She’s here demonstrating the prowess of the Mustang as the iconic car turns 60.\n\nIt has appeared in more than 5,000 films and TV shows. Steve McQueen charging through the streets of San Francisco in his 1968 Mustang GT is in every sense of the word, iconic.\n\nSteve McQueen in 1968’s “Bullitt.” Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nFrom “John Wick” to “Gone in 60 Seconds” to “Charlie’s Angels” to thousands of other productions, “the producers want the Mustang because it creates a symbol. You know, they don’t have to introduce [the character] with a with a heavy storyline. Because the minute you see the Mustang, you know what you’re going to see? You know, it’s freedom, it’s power, it’s sound,” says Ted Ryan, Ford archives and heritage brand manager.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe Mustang debuted at the New York World’s Fair on April 17, 1964, but even before the public saw it, the car had been used in the James Bond film “Goldfinger,” which was released in September 1964.\n\n“And ‘Goldfinger’ is the first time Mustang appeared on film,” says Ryan. “It was actually a pre-production version of the Mustang that was sent to Walter Hayes, who headed our PR team and London and it was to generate buzz for the Mustang. So we sent it over.”\n\nRyan notes that Henry Ford II and the Bond franchise producers, the Broccolli family, knew each other. “The Broccoli family requested the Mustang because they’ve heard about the buzz on the car,” Ryan says. They in turn sent the car, which was a pre-production model, to Alan Mann Racing to prep the car for the film and offered a stunt driver as well.\n\n“Although that car is one of those missing ones out there. Nobody knows where that car is,” he says. Although, “I got a request from the Ian Fleming Foundation, who owned a couple of the other Bond Mustangs, to help them find the VIN number because they’re still trying to track it down.”\n\nWhile Bond is associated with the Aston Martin, plenty of Mustangs have joined the super spy’s adventures. The Mustang Mach 1 starred in 1971’s “Diamonds Are Forever.” In the film, Sean Connery lead a posse of hapless police on a chase through downtown Las Vegas in a red Mach 1. Ford had stunt drivers who would go around the country and demonstrate the different capabilities of the cars, according to Ryan. That scene was filmed with Ford stunt drivers, not Hollywood stunt drivers.\n\nWhat’s Ford’s involvement in these productions?\n\n“If the production is one that Ford is fully supporting, yes, we do work with them. We’ll have the mechanics on hand for prep. We’ll do all that kind of stuff. In some cases, the producers make the movie and never even asked Ford one way or the other. But for all the different Bond films, there were Ford people on site overseeing the use of the vehicle and the scenes,” says Ryan.\n\n“The Eleanors [from “Gone in Sixty Seconds”] were custom jobs and those were supported. The “John Wicks” are custom jobs and those who supported. “Bullitt” was supported as well. And if it wasn’t Ford, we were farming it out to Carroll Shelby and his team to get him prepped or Holman-Moody and their team to get him prepped.”\n\nDoes Ryan have a favorite celebrity Mustang?\n\n“It isn’t an appearance, but it’s a story. Jim Morrison from the Doors only ever owned one car. And it was a GT 350 and he called it Little Blue. And if you Google Jim Morrison and the Doors, you’ll see lots of stories about it. And there’s a famous picture of him in the car in the desert. And there’s a beer on the dashboard. It’s totally on brand for Jim Morrison. It was just the fact that he bought into the Mustang identity — even nicknaming his car and the GT 350 with the power that it presented. Other than that, I’m a Bond fanatic, so I love the different Bond appearances,” Ryan says.\n\nThen he thinks some more: “Actually, like the original ‘Gone in 60 Seconds’ more than I like the second one. And the ‘John Wick’ Mustangs.”\n\nAs it turns 60, the Mustang still telegraphs American innovation, performance and style. “I always use it [this line], but to me that generation, the baby boomer generation, they wanted their own music and they got the Beatles. They wanted their own fashion and they got bell bottoms and long hair. And they wanted their own car and they got the Mustang. It was the perfect car” for that generation.",

        "text": "A GitHub flaw, or possibly a design decision, is being abused by threat actors to distribute malware using URLs associated with a Microsoft repository, making the files appear trustworthy.\n\nWhile most of the malware activity has been based around the Microsoft GitHub URLs, this \"flaw\" could be abused with any public repository on GitHub, allowing threat actors to create very convincing lures.\n\nAbusing GitHub's file upload feature\n\nYesterday, McAfee released a report on a new LUA malware loader distributed through what appeared to be a legitimate Microsoft GitHub repository for the \"C++ Library Manager for Windows, Linux, and MacOS,\" known as vcpkg.\n\nThe URLs for the malware installers, shown below, clearly indicate that they belong to the Microsoft repo, but we could not find any reference to the files in the project's source code.\n\nhttps://github[.]com/microsoft/vcpkg/files/14125503/Cheat.Lab.2.7.2.zip https://github[.]com/microsoft/STL/files/14432565/Cheater.Pro.1.6.0.zip\n\nFinding it strange that a Microsoft repo would be distributing malware since February, BleepingComputer looked into it and found that the files are not part of vcpkg but were uploaded as part of a comment left on a commit or issue in the project.\n\nWhen leaving a comment, a GitHub user can attach a file, which will be uploaded to GitHub's CDN and associated with the related project using a unique URL in this format: 'https://www.github.com/{project_user}/{repo_name}/files/{file_id}/{file_name}.'\n\nInstead of generating the URL after a comment is posted, GitHub automatically generates the download link after you add the file to an unsaved comment, as shown below. This allows threat actors to attach their malware to any repository without them knowing.\n\nDownload link auto-generated when adding a file to a comment\n\nSource: BleepingComputer\n\nEven if you decide not to post the comment or delete it after it is posted, the files are not deleted from GitHub's CDN, and the download URLs continue to work forever.\n\nAs the file's URL contains the name of the repository the comment was created in, and as almost every software company uses GitHub, this flaw can allow threat actors to develop extraordinarily crafty and trustworthy lures.\n\nFor example, a threat actor could upload a malware executable in NVIDIA's driver installer repo that pretends to be a new driver fixing issues in a popular game. Or a threat actor could upload a file in a comment to the Google Chromium source code and pretend it's a new test version of the web browser.\n\nThese URLs would also appear to belong to the company's repositories, making them far more trustworthy.\n\nUnfortunately, even if a company learns their repos are abused to distribute malware, BleepingComputer could not find any settings that allow you to manage files attached to your projects.\n\nFurthermore, you can only protect a GitHub account from being abused in this way and tarnishing your reputation by disabling comments. According to this GitHub support document, you can only temporarily disable comments for a maximum of six months at a time.\n\nHowever, restricting comments can significantly impact a project's development as it will not allow users to report bugs or suggestions.\n\nSergei Frankoff, of automated malware analysis service UNPACME, did a livestream on Twitch about this bug just last month, saying that threat actors were actively abusing it.\n\nWeeks later... GitHub bug still dropping malware pic.twitter.com/s165zOAsoI — herrcore (@herrcore) March 27, 2024\n\nAs part of our research into this bug, BleepingComputer could only find one other repo, httprouter, abused to distribute malware in this way, and it was the same 'Cheater.Pro.1.6.0.zip' as seen in Microsoft's URLs.\n\nHowever, Frankoff told BleepingComputer that they discovered a similar campaign in March that utilizes the same LUA loader malware, which is called SmartLoader, disguised as the Aimmy cheat software.\n\nFrankoff told BleepingComputer that SmartLoader is commonly installed alongside other payloads, such as the RedLine information-stealing malware.\n\nBleepingComputer contacted both GitHub and Microsoft on Thursday about this abuse but did not receive a response.\n\nAt the time of this publication, the information-stealing malware is still being distributed through links associated with Microsoft' GitHub repository.",

        "text": "One-hundred words. That is the court fight some parents in California are waging against Democratic lawmakers and the Newsom Administration, who are trying to stop voters from a proposed ballot measure that would require schools to notify parents if a child is changing their gender. The initiative would also protect female sports from transgender athletes (born males) and mandate that students use school facilities consistent with their birth gender.\n\nPolls show a majority of Californian voters support the measures. However, the state legislature, where Democrats enjoy a super majority, refused to hear the bill, and Democrat State Attorney General Rob Bonta changed the initiative's title from \"Protect Kids of California Act\" to the \"Restrict Rights of Transgender Youth\" initiative.\n\nCALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS ADVANCE BILL CREATING GENEALOGY OFFICE TO DETERMINE REPARATIONS ELIGIBILITY\n\nSupporters also say Bonta changed the required 100-word summary of the initiative in a negative, misleading and pejorative way that they claim makes it nearly impossible to gather signatures or raise money.\n\n\"His bias on these issues is clear, and he's allowed to have his opinion,\" says Dean McGee of the Liberty Justice Center, which brought the lawsuit against Bonta. \"What he's not allowed to do is mess with the democratic process in California.

It claims changing words such as \"protect,\" \"ensure,\" and \"fairness\" to \"require, restrict and prohibit\" typically doom measures to fail at the ballot box.\n\nCALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARD PRESIDENT ORDERED TO PAY LEGAL FEES AFTER LGBTQ FLAG DEBATE, DEATH THREATS\n\n\"He's attempting to bypass California's abilities to evaluate this issue neutrally by writing a biased summary that people will be unlikely to support,\" claims McGee.

The parents’ group says it will likely appeal and hope to get on the 2026 ballot.",

        "text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works\n\nAs per the speculations, we are soon approaching the launch of Google's next mid-range offering, the Pixel 8a, but the leaks haven't stopped pouring in. We recently saw leaks showcasing the device in all four colors Google is planning to launch it in. Then, we have also seen the alleged Google Pixel 8a in real-life images. Now, we have leaked the pricing of the Google Pixel 8a in Canada, which will disappoint you considering the package that is being offered for that particular price.\n\nA fresh leak from PassionateGeekz shows the pricing of the Pixel 8a on a Canadian retailer's website listing. According to the leak, the Pixel 8a 128GB variant is allegedly priced at CAD 705 (roughly $510), while the 256GB variant is allegedly priced at CAD 790 (roughly $572). This is a huge CAD 200 (approx. $144) increase when compared to the CAD 599 launch price of the Pixel 7a.\n\nIf the leak turns out to be true, then charging CAD 200 ($145) more for a phone with just about okay-ish upgrades over last year's model is just asking too much. Speaking of specs, the Pixel 8a is alleged to be powered by the Tensor G3 chipset paired with 8GB of RAM. It will offer 128/256GB of onboard storage.\n\nThe phone is expected to come with a 6.1-inch 120Hz OLED display with a peak brightness of 1,400 nits. Pixel 8a will carry the same cameras as the Pixel 7a, i.e., a 64-megapixel main camera, 13-megapixel ultrawide camera, and 13-megapixel selfie camera.\n\nThe Pixel \"A\" series has always been positioned as a budget offering from Google that comes with most of the features of the standard Pixel phones at a low cost. However, looking at the leaked pricing, the Pixel 8a doesn't seem to fit well in the budget category. Well, these are just leaks and rumors at the moment, and anything unofficial should always be taken with a huge grain of salt.",

        "text": "Morgan Wallen has spoken out following his recent arrest in Nashville.\n\n“I didn’t feel right publicly checking in until I made amends with some folks,” Wallen, 30, wrote via X on Friday, April 19. “I’ve touched base with Nashville law enforcement, my family and the good people at Chief’s. I’m not proud of my behavior, and I accept responsibility.”\n\nHe continued, “I have the utmost respect for the officers working every day to keep us all safe. Regarding my tour, there will be no change.” (Wallen is scheduled to perform at the University of Mississippi on Saturday, April 20, before heading to Michigan several days later. His tour runs through October.)\n\nUs Weekly confirmed on April 8 that the country singer had been arrested and charged with three felony counts of reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct in Nashville one day earlier. Wallen was released on a $15,250 bond and is set to appear in court on May 3.\n\nRelated: Morgan Wallen’s Ups and Downs Through the Years Morgan Wallen has become the bad boy of country music after facing a series of scandals throughout his career. The “Whiskey Glasses” singer got his start on season 6 of The Voice in 2014, where he was a member of Adam Levine’s team but got knocked out during the playoffs. Two years after his appearance […]\n\nWallen’s attorney, Worrick Robinson, later told Us in a statement that his client was “cooperating fully” with local authorities.\n\nAccording to local police officers, they were standing outside a bar in downtown Nashville when a chair fell from above them. Restaurant employees had claimed that Wallen threw the seat off a balcony from six stories high.\n\nWhile Wallen has not revealed what caused his alleged meltdown, his ex Katie “KT” Smith has denied any correlation to her recent marriage. (Smith, who shares son Indigo with Wallen, married Luke Scornavacco on April 5, two days before Wallen’s arrest.)\n\nRelated: Celebrity Mugshots See which stars have been behind bars, ranging from Justin Bieber to Reese Witherspoon\n\n“Although it may seem like it correlates because of the timeline. I have no evidence to believe the incident had anything to do with the recent marriage announcement,” Smith told The Daily Beast earlier this month. “I cannot speak on Morgan’s behalf, but I do pray the very best for him. Praying that this was just a slip-up and that he will return to the good path that he was on prior.”\n\nSmith and Wallen dated between 2017 and 2019, welcoming Indigo one year after their breakup. The exes were spotted out and about in Nashville with their son just a few days after his latest arrest.\n\nWallen, who had previously been arrested for public intoxication and disorderly conduct, vowed to change his behavior upon Indigo’s birth.\n\n“Little Wilder, I’m a changed man. Since you came into the world Friday, I see mine differently now,” he wrote via Instagram in July 2020. “It’s not just me anymore, and I’m glad it’s not. This year has been the hardest of my life in so many ways, but that’s not what I will remember it by.”",

        "text": "Table of Contents 1. Back Up Your Website 2. Check Your DNS Settings 3. Transfer Files to a New Domain 4. Make Sure to Redirect Pages 5. Fix Broken Links 6. Let Google Know About the Site Transfer 7. Check Your Site\n\nEveryone hates moving. Whether it's across town or across the country, the act of packing up your belongings and making sure everything ends up in your new home is taxing. That's also true for transferring your website from one web hosting service to another.\n\nUnlike moving in the real world, you may have no clue how to move blog posts, images, video, and other content to the new domain. Don’t fret; we're here to walk you through the necessary steps to make the process as simple as possible.\n\n1. Back Up Your Website\n\nWe assume that you've already found a new web host and domain name for your site. Now, you must pack everything for the move. In this case, that means backing up your website. There are three main ways to do this.\n\nThe WordPress Method\n\nIf you’re working with a WordPress-powered website, you need a WordPress plug-in to wrap up everything. All-in-One WP Migration, Duplicator, and UpdraftPlus are just three of the many options. These easy-to-use plug-ins let you backup your WordPress site with just a few clicks. Using Duplicator, for example, you should:\n\nClick “Packages” and then “Create New.” This creates a package containing all your site and WordPress elements. It also includes an installer. Download the site archive package.\n\nThe cPanel Method\n\nYou can also use a website's control panel to backup files. Many popular web hosts use cPanel, for example, to manage files. Here's how to do it:\n\nWithin cPanel, navigate to the “Files” section and click “Backup Wizard.” Make partial backups of your home directory, MySQL databases, and email forwarders. In an odd wrinkle, you don’t want to create a full backup, because you can’t restore from it.\n\nThe FTP Method\n\nIf you’re familiar with working in a site’s backend, you could backup your site files via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and phpMyAdmin. This method is also useful if you are moving large files. You can perform an FTP backup with any FTP client—we recommend FileZilla, an excellent piece of free software. Make sure to install the FileZilla Client, and not the FileZilla server.\n\nIn addition, you’ll need to have the old site's sign-in credentials. Here’s how to do it:\n\nSign in with the FTP client—or use the File Manager built-in to many control panels—and download the contents of the “Public_HTML” folder. Then you’ll want to find phpMyAdmin; it’s usually in your control panel’s “Databases” section. Click the “Export” tab, “Quick” as the Export method, and “SQL” as the format. Click “Go.” Doing so creates a database file that automatically downloads to your PC.\n\n(Credit: FileZilla)\n\n2. Check Your DNS Settings\n\nDid you acquire a new domain name from an independent domain registrar? Did the new domain come as part of a web hosting package? Regardless, make sure that your domain name system (DNS) settings are correct before transferring files.\n\nA DNS record ties your domain name to your website and server. These DNS records are usually an IP address, a subset of four numbers (104.17.210.9, for example). There are also general nameservers that come in URL form. You’ll get these from your web hosting provider. If your registrar and web host are the same, you can skip this step. If not, you must add that information to your domain name registrar. Here’s how to do it:\n\nLog onto your new domain server account and check the server details. This will be in a different spot for each hosting provider. This should include your DNS record and nameservers. Log onto your domain registrar and edit the DNS record and nameservers to match your new domain. Wait, as it can take 24-48 hours for the process to work.\n\n3. Transfer Files to a New Domain\n\nThis step is essentially the reverse of the first step. You’ll need an archive of all the files from your original site’s directory, as well as the database, which tells your web server where all the content goes. It’s important to make sure both are in the right place.\n\nFirst, make sure the new website already has a database. (For WordPress sites, this will usually be wp-config.php.) Then, using phpMyAdmin, import the archive file's content into the existing database. Select the “Import” options in phpMyAdmin, choose the file on your PC, and click “Go.” This should import all the database entries from your old site into the new one. Now, you can transfer your site files.\n\nHow to Transfer Files Using WordPress\n\nYou’ll need to use the installer and archive package you downloaded in the first step. If you installed the All-in-One WP Migration plugin, for example, do so in your new server. Use an FTP client or the built-in File Manager to connect to your new web host Click the installer to begin the restoration process.\n\nUpdraftPlus and similar plug-ins may have a clone or migrate option that lets you restore everything from a file on your PC.\n\nHow to Transfer Files Using cPanel\n\nIf you went the cPanel route, simply go to the Backup Wizard on your new domain and restore your site from the previously created files. This is the “no muss, no fuss” option.\n\nHow to Transfer Files Using FTP\n\nUse an FTP client or the site’s built-in File Manager to connect to your new web host. Upload the files from your old site's home directory archive to the new host's home directory. Upload your database files.\n\n4. Make Sure to Redirect Pages\n\nIf you want traffic heading to your old domain to make its way to your new one, you need to redirect the old site to the new site. Otherwise, people will see a 404 Page Not Found error when they try to reach your site at the old domain. You can set up a 301 redirect in .htaccess to get traffic to the correct URL. Follow these steps to set up your redirects:\n\nUse FTP or the File Manager to connect to your old domain’s registrar or hosting account. Edit the .htaccess file. This will be in your home directory or in the same directory as your wp-admin folder for WordPress users. Open the .htaccess file and add the following code:\n\n#Options +FollowSymLinksRewriteEngine onRewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.mydomain.com/$1 [R=301,L]\n\nReplace “mydomain.com” with your new domain name.\n\nNow, your old domain name should redirect to your new one. If it doesn’t, you should contact your old hosting service's tech support team for assistance.\n\n5. Fix Broken Links\n\nIf you did everything right, the new site's links should work. However, some links may break and Google may penalize you for it (you don't want that!). So use Dead Link Checker, Dr. Link Check, or w3C Link Checker to discover those broken links. You must fix each dead link one by one, editing their locations by hand. It's worth the effort, though.\n\n6. Let Google Know About the Site Transfer\n\nNow let Google know about your new home! This is especially important if you've performed 301 redirects to your new site. You can do this using some of Google’s own tools.\n\nIf you’re using the Google Search Console with your old domain, click the gear icon, and select “Change of Address.” Input your new domain name here, and let Google handle the search traffic redirect.\n\nYou’ll also want to have an XML sitemap for your new domain. If you’re using WordPress, here’s how to make that happen.\n\nInstall the Yoast SEO plugin. The plugin will automatically create an XML sitemap at: http://newsite.com/sitemap_index.xml. That's it!\n\nIf you’re not using a WordPress-powered site, there are other options.\n\nVisit XML-Sitemaps.com to generate one for your new website. Download the file created, and then use an FTP client or File Manager to upload the file to your site’s home directory. The file should be “sitemap.xml,” meaning its URL will be: http://newsite.com/sitemap.xml Then, under Google Search Consoles, click on “Sitemaps” under the “Index” section. Then you can add whichever URL above and click “Submit.”\n\nNow, Google can crawl your website with ease.\n\n7. Check Your Site\n\nThe last step is the easy one: Check your new domain! Take time to click around your site to ensure all the posts, images, and videos are in their correct locations. Fix any missing items on your backend.\n\nTell your community about the domain change if you have a fairly popular site. You may have service interruptions as the migration process moves forward, so it’s good to let your visitors know why. Regardless, welcome to your new home on the web.\n\nFor more on web hosting, check out The Best Courses for Learning How to Build Websites.

Whether it's across town or across the country, the act of packing up your belongings and making sure everything ends up in your new home is taxing. Now, you must pack everything for the move. This creates a package containing all your site and WordPress elements. The cPanel Method\n\nYou can also use a website's control panel to backup files. Many popular web hosts use cPanel, for example, to manage files. Here's how to do it:\n\nWithin cPanel, navigate to the “Files” section and click “Backup Wizard.” In an odd wrinkle, you don’t want to create a full backup, because you can’t restore from it. This method is also useful if you are moving large files. Did the new domain come as part of a web hosting package? If not, you must add that information to your domain name registrar. You’ll need an archive of all the files from your original site’s directory, as well as the database, which tells your web server where all the content goes.

        "text": "Flagship Manufacturers Might Need To Aim For 6,000 mAh With The SD 8 Gen 4\n\nImage: Peter Holden/TalkAndroid\n\nDigital Chat Station, a pretty reputable leaker on Weibo, has given us our first interesting piece of information regarding the upcoming Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipset. While reports seemed to hint at the chipset being built on a 3nm process (which in theory, should make it more power-efficient), it seems that the chip is going to be a major power hog due to very high performance.\n\nIt seems that three companies have already started testing the chipset in some of their upcoming flagships, and each of these phones has a 5,500 mAh battery capacity. Digital Chat Station also mentioned in one of his replies that battery capacities may generally exceed 6,000 mAh in many of the flagships that will opt for this chip.\n\nImage Credit: OnePlus\n\nThe question is, why is Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 going to be so power-hungry? The answer seems to be that efficiency won't be in the plans for this SoC. Most chips come with performance cores for intense work like video editing and gaming, and efficiency cores to save battery for less demanding tasks. However, it seems this chip is going to pass on efficiency cores and go all performance.\n\nOf course, this also means that there's a risk of this chip also turning your phone into a hand warmer, but along with bigger batteries, I assume that interested flagships will also come with well-thought-out cooling mechanisms.\n\nRumor Has It That The Exynos 2500 Will Beat Qualcomm's Next Chip In Performance\n\nImage: Samsung\n\nNow, take this with a healthy dose of skepticism, but a rumor from a now-protected account on X, called PandaFlashPro, claims that the Exynos 2500 is going to come swinging for the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, and will in fact, beat it in both efficiency and power. Considering the original leaker has locked their account, it's hard to take this with much certainty, however, if it is true, that would be incredibly interesting.\n\nSamsung's Exynos chips aren't the best known for performance, especially when placed beside Qualcomm's options. However, the Exynos 2400 wasn't a slouch and if the Exynos 2500 manages to match up with the SD 8 Gen 4, I won't be too shocked at that (though I still feel these claims are very bold).\n\nAgain, it is also rumored that the chip might opt for a Google-made NPU instead of one fabricated by Samsung. This would be a good move especially if Samsung's direction for AI is to rely on the direction that Google plans to go in with Gemini.\n\n1. Changes of AI Engine\n\n\n\nFrom 2200 ~ 2400 Samsung Keep Developed own Neural Processor and Digital Signal Processor.\n\n\n\nBut it didn't boost the Android ML Layer, or Google Mobile Service System App Services.\n\n\n\nAnd thats the reason the 2500 AI Engine gets Google TPU to Boost ML, GMS. https://t.co/8ix6L5F5GF pic.twitter.com/0kNmYpkXS9 — Connor/코너/コナー (@OreXda) April 2, 2024\n\nAgain, all of these are loose rumors, but if we hear anything more certain, we'll be sure to let you all know.",

        "title": "Tom Ultican: The Profit Behind the “Science of Reading” Movement",
        "text": "Tom Ultican, retired teacher in California, smells a scam in the making. The science behind “the Science of Reading” movement is not very scientific, he writes. Publishers and vendors are preparing to cash in on legislative mandates that force reading teachers to use only one method to teach reading despite the lack of evidence for its efficacy. Ultican zeroes in on the role of billionaire Laurene Powell Jobs as one of the key players in promoting SofR.\n\nHe writes:\n\nLaurene Powell Jobs controls Amplify, a kids-at-screens education enterprise. In 2011, she became one of the wealthiest women in the world when her husband, Steve, died. This former Silicon Valley housewife displays the arrogance of wealth, infecting all billionaires. She is now a “philanthropist”, in pursuit of both her concerns and biases. Her care for the environment and climate change are admiral but her anti-public school thinking is a threat to America. Her company, Amplify, sells the antithesis of good education.\n\nI am on Amplify’s mailing list. April third’s new message said,\n\n“What if I told you there’s a way for 95% of your students to read at or near grade level? Maybe you’ve heard the term Science of Reading before, and have wondered what it is and why it matters.”\n\nSpokesperson, Susan Lambert, goes on to disingenuously explain how the Science of Reading (SoR) “refers to the abundance of research illustrating the best way students learn to read.”\n\nThis whopper is followed by a bigger one, stating:\n\n“A shift to a Science of Reading-based curriculum can help give every teacher and student what they need and guarantee literacy success in your school. Tennessee school districts did just that and they are seeing an abundant amount of success from their efforts.”\n\nA shift to SoR-based curriculum is as likely to cause harm as it is to bring literacy success. This was just a used-car salesman style claim. On the other hand, the “abundance of success” in Tennessee is an unadulterated lie. National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) tracks testing over time and is respected for education testing integrity. Tennessee’s NAEP data shows no success “from their efforts.” Their reading scores since 2013 have been down, not a lot but do not demonstrate an “abundance of success”.\n\nNAEP Data Plot 2005 to 2022\n\nAmplify’s Genesis\n\nLarry Berger and Greg Dunn founded Wireless Generation in 2000 to create the software for lessons presented on screens. Ten years later, they sold it to Rupert Murdoch and his News Corporation for $360 million. Berger pocketed $40 million and agreed to stay on as head of curriculum. Wireless Generation was rebranded Amplify and Joel Klein was hired to run it.\n\nMurdoch proposed buying a million I-pads to deliver classroom instruction. However, the Apple operating system was not flexible enough to run the software. The android system developed at Google met their needs. They purchased the Taiwanese-made Asus Tablets, well regarded in the market place but not designed for the rigors of school use. Another issue was that Wireless Generation had not developed curriculum but Murdoch wanted to beat Pearson and Houghton Mifflin to the digital education market place … so they forged ahead.\n\nIn 2012, the corporate plan was rolling along until the wheels came off. In Guilford County, North Carolina, the school district won a Race to the Top grant of $30 million dollars which it used to experiment with digital learning. The district’s plancalled for nearly 17,000 students in 20 middle schools to receive Amplify tablets. When a charger for one of the tablets overheated, the plan was halted. Only two months into the experiment, they found not only had a charger malfunctioned but another 175 chargers had issues and 1500 screens were kid-damaged.\n\nThis was the beginning of the end.\n\nBy August of 2015, News Corporation announced it was exiting the education business. The corporation took a $371 million dollar write-off. The next month, they announced selling Amplify to members of its staff. In the deal orchestrated by Joel Klein, who remained a board member, Larry Berger assumed leadership of the company.\n\nThree months later, Reuters reported that the real buyer was Laurene Powell Jobs. She purchased Amplify through her LLC, the Emerson Collective. In typical Powell Jobs style, no information was available for how much of the company she would personally control.\n\nBecause Emerson Collective is an LLC, it can purchase private companies and is not required to make money details public. However, the Waverley Street Foundation, also known as the Emerson Collective Foundation, is a 501 C3 (EIN: 81-3242506) that must make money transactions public. Waverly Street received their tax exempt status November 9, 2016.\n\nSoR A Sales Scam\n\nThe Amplify email gave me a link to two documents that were supposed to explain SoR: (Navigating the shift to evidence-based literacy instruction 6 takeaways from Amplify’s Science of Reading: The Symposium) and (Change Management Playbook Navigating and sustaining change when implementing a Science of Reading curriculum). Let’s call them Symposium and Navigating.\n\nNavigating tells readers that it helps teachers move away from ineffective legacy practices and start making shifts to evidence-based practices. The claim that “legacy practices” are “ineffective” is not evidence-based. The other assertion that SoR is evidence-based has no peer-reviewed research backing it.\n\nSally Riordan is a Senior Research Fellow at the University College London. In Britain, they have many of the same issues with reading instruction. In her recent research, she noted:\n\n“In 2023, however, researchers at the University of Warwick pointed out something that should have been obvious for some time but has been very much overlooked – that following the evidence is not resulting in the progress we might expect.\n\n“A series of randomised controlled trials, including one looking at how to improve literacy through evidence, have suggested that schools that use methods based on research are not performing better than schools that do not.”\n\nIn Symposium, we see quotes from Kareem Weaver who co-founded Fulcrum in Oakland, California and is its executive director. Weaver also was managing director of the New School Venture Fund, where Powell Jobs served on the board. He works for mostly white billionaires to the detriment of his community. (Page 15)\n\nBoth Symposium and Navigating have the same quote, “Our friends at the Reading League say that instruction based on the Science of Reading ‘will elevate and transform every community, every nation, through the power of literacy.”’\n\nWho is the Reading League and where did they come from?\n\nDr. Maria Murray is the founder and CEO of The Reading League. It seems to have been hatched at the University of Syracuse and State University of New York at Oswego by Murray and Professor Jorene Finn in 2017. That year, they took in $11,044 in contributions (EIN: 81-0820021) and in 2018, another $109,652. Then in 2019, their revenues jumped 20 times to $2,240,707!\n\nJorene Finn worked for Cambria Learning Group and was a LETRS facilitator at Lexia. That means the group had serious connections to the corporate SoR initiative before they began.\n\nWith Amplify’s multiple citations of The Reading League, I speculated that the source of that big money in 2019 might have been Powell Jobs. Her Waverly Street Foundation (AKA Emerson Collective Foundation) only shows one large donation of $95,000,000 in 2019. It went to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation (EIN: 20-5205488), a donor-directed dark money fund.\n\nThere is no way of following that $95 million.\n\nThe Reading League Brain Scan Proving What?\n\nProfessor Paul Thomas of Furman University noted the League’s over-reliance on brain scans and shared:\n\n“Many researchers in neurobiology (e.g., Elliott et al., 2020; Hickok, 2014; Lyon, 2017) have voiced alarming concerns about the validity and preciseness of brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect reliable biomarkers in processes such as reading and in the diagnosis of other mental activity….\n\n“And Mark Seidenberg, a key neuroscientist cited by the “science of reading” movement, offers a serious wcaution about the value of brain research: “Our concern is that although reading science is highly relevant to learning in the classroom setting, it does not yet speak to what to teach, when, how, and for whom at a level that is useful for teachers.”\n\n“Beware The Reading League because it is an advocacy movement that is too often little more than cherry-picking, oversimplification, and a thin veneer for commercial interests in the teaching of reading.”\n\nThe push to implement SoR is a new way to sell what Amplify originally called “personalized learning.”This corporate movement conned legislators, many are co-conspirators, into passing laws forcing schools and teachers to use the SoR-related programs, equipment and testing.\n\nSoR is about economic gain for its purveyors and not science based.\n\nWhen politicians and corporations control education, children and America lose.\n\nTo read an earlier post by Tom Ultican on this topic, see this.",

        "text": "The Pepper app is out with a targeted offer that looks fantastic for some users. Unfortunately, there are at least two different targeted offers available, so the utility of this one will vary a bit. Keep in mind that it’s going to take a while to receive the full rewards, so proceed with some caution.\n\nThe Deal\n\nThe Pepper app is offering some customers 10% back everywhere through May 31, 2024 .\n\n. Others are targeted for 10% back only on the following brands: Nike Google Play REI The Container Store Overstock PetSmart Michaels JTV Dave & Buster’s Under Armour Build-A-Bear Workshop TGI Fridays Finish Line Belk Petco Adidas Kirkland’s Fanatics Smashburger Smoothie King\n\n\n\nIf you’re new to the Pepper Rewards app\n\nIf you’re new to the Pepper Rewards app, I believe that new users get double points (10% back) for the first 15 days. Feel free to sign up using one of our referral codes with our thanks.\n\nStephen: 581887\n\nGreg: 582066\n\nNick: 582027\n\nTim: 582099\n\nKey Terms\n\nExpires 5/31/24\n\nBonus points will be issued on June 15, 2024 by 5pm ET\n\nQuick Thoughts\n\nThe Pepper app sells gift cards to a wide range of stores. At least some of those stores — like Amazon and Walmart — are rarely available at discounted prices. That makes this offer particularly notable — and quite incredible given that it is valid all the way until May 31st, and seemingly without limit. I do believe that the Pepper app was limiting users to buying no more than $1,000 per day when they launched earlier this year, but given that this is valid for six weeks, that doesn’t represent a low ceiling.\n\nIt is important to recognize that there are at least two different targeted forms of this Pepper app promotion.\n\nBoth my wife and I received the offer for 10% back everywhere through May 31, 2024, but some have received an offer just for the selected brands shown under “The Deal” above. That could still be a good deal for some of the included brands.\n\nThe way this deal works is that you’ll get the usual 5% back up front, but do note that the additional 5% back isn’t scheduled to post until June 15, 2024. That means that if you bought gift cards today, you’d be waiting nearly 2 months to get the entire 10% back (and then it is in the form of rewards that you’ll need to use on more gift cards). My wife and I originally signed up a couple of months ago during the launch where Pepper offered 10% back everywhere for 30 days. I was relatively cautious — I bought a couple thousand dollars in gift cards, but I ended up wishing I’d bought more gift cards than I did.\n\nNonetheless, I would be remiss not to encourage a modicum of caution here. The Pepper app has taken off at a breakneck pace with a couple of spicy offers to earn 10% back at brands that are never available at that high of a rate. I have no indication that these firey deals are going to burn down the house any time soon, but one has to wonder how sustainable it is to offer 10% back on all gift card brands. I’ll surely purchase some gift cards with this deal, but I’ll look to redeem the initial 5% back in the near-term and not get myself in so deep as to need the other 5%. Again, I have no reason to think that the other 5% won’t come in June, but I won’t get involved for more than I can afford to absorb if the app didn’t last that long.\n\nH/T: GC Galore",

        "text": "It’s clear that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have “alchemy” in spades.\n\nSwift, 34, uploaded a YouTube Short on Friday, April 19, introducing a social media challenge inspired by her song “Fortnight.” In the pop star’s clip, she included a “recap” of moments in her daily life from filming the “Fortnight” music video with Ethan Hawke, hitting the gym, playing with her cats (Meredith Grey, Olivia Benson and Benjamin Button, respectively) and making her famed cinnamon rolls. Two additional stills prominently feature cameos from Kelce, 34.\n\nIn one part of the footage, Kelce bends down to kiss Swift’s cheek while she stirs vegetables in a sauté pan in her kitchen. Swift looked casually chic in a black crop top, a pair of jeans and a gold necklace. Kelce, for his part, coordinated with his girlfriend in a black shirt. A second still includes footage of Swift, dressed in a black frock, holding hands with Kelce during a date night at Singapore’s Garden by the Bay. (Kelce visited Swift in the Asian country last month when she performed her Eras Tour in town.)\n\nIn additional video scenes, Swift shows her support for Kansas City, where Kelce lives and plays for the city’s Chiefs pro football team. At one point, Swift played pickleball with a Chiefs-branded paddle. Later, she wore a University of Kansas sweatshirt while doing embroidery. (KU’s main campus is in Lawrence, Kansas, not Kansas City but it is less than a fortnight’s drive away.)\n\nRelated: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s Relationship Timeline Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are all anyone can talk about. Swift and Kelce were first linked in July 2023 when the Kansas City Chiefs tight end shared he attempted to ask Swift out after attending her Eras Tour. “I was a little butthurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I […]\n\nSeveral hours earlier, Swift dropped her 11th studio album: The Tortured Poets Department. To fans’ surprise, the record appeared to feature shout-outs to Kelce and his NFL career on songs “So High School” and “The Alchemy.”\n\n“So when I touch down / Call the amateurs and cut ’em from the team,” Swift sings on “The Alchemy,” referring to football plays and squads. “Ditch the clowns, get the crown / Baby, I’m the one to be / ‘Cause the sign on your heart / Said it’s still reserved for me / Honestly, who are we to fight thе alchemy?”\n\nThe song’s bridge also seems to refer to the moment Kelce and his Kansas City Chiefs teammates celebrated winning the Super Bowl in February.\n\n“Shirts off and your friends lift you up over their heads,” she sings. “Beer stickin’ to the floor, cheers chanted ’cause they said, ‘There was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league’ / Where’s the trophy? / He just comes runnin’ over to me.”\n\nWhat Is the Best Song on Taylor Swift’s ‘The Tortured Poets Department?’\n\nSwift has been dating Kelce since summer 2023, going public when she went to a Chiefs game the following September. After attending 11 more games, the Grammy winner stepped out at Super Bowl LVIII to cheer on Kelce. When the KC squad won the big game, Swift went onto the field to congratulate her man with a kiss.\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department is out now.",

She got interested in robotics and technology in elementary school, where she joined science clubs and competitions.\n\nBut it was on a trip to India in 2022 to visit family that Marrapu got the pill tracker idea.\n\n\"I was inspired by my grandfather who suffered from a series of heart and brain strokes,\" she says. \"He had so many pills that he couldn't manage it. My grandmother couldn't manage it. It was like a small pharmacy. And I just thought about how important it was for him to make sure he was taking each of those pills.\"\n\nDee Dwyer for NPR Archie Marrapu, from Northern Virginia, created a \"pill tracker\". It's a plastic bottle fitted with ultrasonic sensors and an AI engine that tracks when/if a patient has taken his/her medication, among other things.\n\nMarrapu's father takes medication to keep his diabetes in check. The pill tracker is designed to include an information section that was inspired by him.\n\n\"He really didn't know what other pills he could take with that medication, or if he had any dietary restrictions,\" she says.\n\nMarrapu says there was a lot of confusion during the first weeks after her dad was put on the medication. The family relied on Google and multiple doctor visits, she says.\n\n\"I created a system that would send the user notifications, like, 'you've just taken your pill, please don't consume antacid until 2 hours have passed.' It's a guidance system so that people avoid compromising their medications,\" she says.\n\nMarrapu knows she wants to study biomedical engineering with a minor in entrepreneurship when she goes to college, and her dream is to work in healthcare, she says.\n\n\"To make it more equitable, affordable and accurate as a whole,\" she says. \"Healthcare is something that everyone deserves equally regardless of ethnicity or socioeconomic status.\"\n\nShe exudes self-assuredness and says she is aware of the disadvantages women of color face in STEM, but she's confident her generation will push for change.\n\n\"Whether it's talking to industries about hiring more women, giving women more opportunities with more pay, I think that's something women can change. I think women need to believe that they are enough,\" Marrapu says, emphasizing the word enough. \"They can do whatever men can do, and they deserve whatever men do too.\"\n\nSusie Comings contributed research to this story. contributed to this story\n\nCopyright 2024 NPR.

        "text": "Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News\n\nSpiro has the largest fleet of electric motorcycles on the roads in Africa. Spiro now has over 13,000 electric motorbikes and 40,000 swappable batteries in operation across Benin, Togo, Rwanda, and Kenya. Spiro says, to date, riders have collectively driven almost quarter of a billion kilometers. Spiro also says that, so far, nearly 10 million battery swaps have been done from its over 600 battery swap stations in the markets where the company is currently active.\n\nSpiro has now launched its operations in Nigeria, one of Africa’s largest economies. Spiro says this landmark expansion into Nigeria marks a pivotal moment in the electric mobility landscape of Africa’s largest economy. Spiro’s strategic expansion will see Spiro in up to eight of Nigeria’s major provinces, beginning with Abeokuta, and including Ibadan, Lagos, and Abuja, indicating a dedicated effort to electrify the nation’s mobility.\n\nSpiro cites that, in Africa, greenhouse gas emissions from transportation are growing at a rate of 7% each year. Air pollution is the second biggest killer across the continent, associated with heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer. Around 1.1 million people die prematurely from air pollution in Africa each year.\n\nSpiro’s model is centred around battery swapping, allowing riders to use Spiro’s swapping stations, fast and slow chargers, and home charging solutions. In Nigeria, Spiro has announced strategic partnerships with Max, Dot, and Onocon on a shared vision for a cleaner and healthier world, where riders have access to affordable and reliable transportation and cutting edge technology. Dot is a leading digital microfinance institution in Nigeria, democratizing the ownership of electric bikes in the country. Founded in 2021, Dot has quickly amassed a customer base of over 650,000 by providing comprehensive financial services. The partnership with Onocon Royal Limited signifies Spiro’s strategic approach to penetrating the Nigerian market by leveraging local expertise and networks.\n\nLagos-headquartered MAX describes itself as a technology-enabled company driven by a vision to solve mobility challenges in Africa. MAX has over fourteen branches across Nigeria, Cameroon, and Ghana. It says its work helps to democratise access to vehicle ownership and empower mobility entrepreneurs with financial support services. MAX’s website adds that the company is on a mission to impact people’s lives by revolutionizing their perspective on transportation, ultimately creating positive change and improving their quality of life. They do this by working with transport operators in the informal sector to help deliver increased income generation, financial inclusion, access to high-quality vehicles, training, support services, insurance, healthcare, emergency response, and other value-added services all aimed at empowering them.\n\n“Our expansion into Nigeria, in strategic partnership with Max, Dot and Omnocon, marks a new chapter for Spiro and the broader EV ecosystem in Nigeria. We’ll deploy a significant number of bikes in our first year in Nigeria, as we enable a lifestyle shift towards cleaner, more sustainable transportation options. Our goal is to electrify mobility across Africa, and Nigeria as Africa’s economic powerhouse represents an important step on that journey,” says Kaushik Burman, CEO of Spiro.\n\n“Spiro’s electric bikes promise a future of reduced environmental impact, economic savings, and improved community health. We’re proud to collaborate on this sustainable venture, setting a green standard for transportation in Nigeria,” says Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State.\n\nIts great to see one of the major players in Africa’s nascent electric mobility sector expanding its operations to a major market such as Nigeria. There is a major opportunity in several African countries to really accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles, thereby improving access to essential transport services on a continent with severely low levels of motorisation. This presents a major opportunity for the majority to leapfrog directly into the age of electric mobility, bypassing the ICE age.\n\nImages courtesy of Spiro\n\nHave a tip for CleanTechnica?

The purported Pixel 8a price has also been spotted online, and it looks like customers will have to pay a slightly higher amount to purchase Google's most affordable Pixel 8-series smartphone this year. The successor to last year's Pixel 7a is also expected to receive some AI-related (artificial intelligence) features.\n\nGoogle Pixel 8a price (rumoured)\n\nPassionateGeekz reports that the price of the Pixel 8a in Canada — where the phone was listed by a retailer — will be CAD 708.99 (roughly Rs. 42,830) for the 128GB storage configuration, while the 256GB variant will cost CAD 792.99 (roughly Rs. 47,900). The publication did not reveal the name of the Canadian retailer that listed both variants of the Pixel 8a.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pixel 8a will cost between Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 2,000 more than its predecessor — the Pixel 7a — in India, according to the report. Readers might recall that Google launched the Pixel 7a in May 2023, priced at Rs. 43,999 for the sole 8GB+128GB RAM and storage configuration.\n\nGoogle Pixel 8a specifications (rumoured)\n\nGoogle is likely to equip the Pixel 8a with its Tensor G3 chip that powers the Pixel 8 series of smartphones, which enables support for AI models on the smartphone. However, it is currently unclear whether the Pixel 8a will offer the same compatibility as te more expensive Pixel 8a modes It could be equipped with a 6.1-inch OLED screen, with a 120Hz refresh rate. The phone is expected to offer 5G and 4G LTE connectivity, just like last year's model.\n\nThe upcoming Pixel 8a is tipped to arrive with a dual camera setup that comprises a 64-megapixel primary camera and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide angle camera. The smartphone is also said to measure 153.44 x 72.74 x 8.94mm, which is similar to its predecessor, the Pixel 7a.

        "title": "This Week in AI: When ‘open source’ isn’t so open",
        "text": "Keeping up with an industry as fast-moving as AI is a tall order. So until an AI can do it for you, here’s a handy roundup of recent stories in the world of machine learning, along with notable research and experiments we didn’t cover on their own.\n\nThis week, Meta released the latest in its Llama series of generative AI models: Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B. Capable of analyzing and writing text, the models are “open sourced,” Meta said — intended to be a “foundational piece” of systems that developers design with their unique goals in mind.\n\n“We believe these are the best open source models of their class, period,” Meta wrote in a blog post. “We are embracing the open source ethos of releasing early and often.”\n\nThere’s only one problem: the Llama 3 models aren’t really “open source,” at least not in the strictest definition.\n\nOpen source implies that developers can use the models how they choose, unfettered. But in the case of Llama 3 — as with Llama 2 — Meta has imposed certain licensing restrictions. For example, Llama models can’t be used to train other models. And app developers with over 700 million monthly users must request a special license from Meta.\n\nDebates over the definition of open source aren’t new. But as companies in the AI space play fast and loose with the term, it’s injecting fuel into long-running philosophical arguments.\n\nLast August, a study co-authored by researchers at Carnegie Mellon, the AI Now Institute and the Signal Foundation found that many AI models branded as “open source” come with big catches — not just Llama. The data required to train the models is kept secret. The compute power needed to run them is beyond the reach of many developers. And the labor to fine-tune them is prohibitively expensive.\n\nSo if these models aren’t truly open source, what are they, exactly? That’s a good question; defining open source with respect to AI isn’t an easy task.\n\nOne pertinent unresolved question is whether copyright, the foundational IP mechanism open source licensing is based on, can be applied to the various components and pieces of an AI project, in particular a model’s inner scaffolding (e.g. embeddings). Then, there’s the mismatch between the perception of open source and how AI actually functions to overcome: open source was devised in part to ensure that developers could study and modify code without restrictions. With AI, though, which ingredients you need to do the studying and modifying is open to interpretation.\n\nWading through all the uncertainty, the Carnegie Mellon study does make clear the harm inherent in tech giants like Meta co-opting the phrase “open source.”\n\nOften, “open source” AI projects like Llama end up kicking off news cycles — free marketing — and providing technical and strategic benefits to the projects’ maintainers. The open source community rarely sees these same benefits, and, when they do, they’re marginal compared to the maintainers’.\n\nInstead of democratizing AI, “open source” AI projects — especially those from big tech companies — tend to entrench and expand centralized power, say the study’s co-authors. That’s good to keep in mind the next time a major “open source” model release comes around.\n\nHere are some other AI stories of note from the past few days:\n\nMeta updates its chatbot: Coinciding with the Llama 3 debut, Meta upgraded its AI chatbot across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp — Meta AI — with a Llama 3-powered backend. It also launched new features, including faster image generation and access to web search results.\n\nCoinciding with the Llama 3 debut, Meta upgraded its AI chatbot across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp — Meta AI — with a Llama 3-powered backend.

OpenAI lands in Japan: OpenAI is expanding to Japan, with the opening of a new Tokyo office and plans for a GPT-4 model optimized specifically for the Japanese language.\n\nMore machine learnings\n\nCan a chatbot change your mind? Swiss researchers found that not only can they, but if they are pre-armed with some personal information about you, they can actually be more persuasive in a debate than a human with that same info.\n\n“This is Cambridge Analytica on steroids,” said project lead Robert West from EPFL. The researchers suspect the model — GPT-4 in this case — drew from its vast stores of arguments and facts online to present a more compelling and confident case. But the outcome kind of speaks for itself. Don’t underestimate the power of LLMs in matters of persuasion, West warned: “In the context of the upcoming US elections, people are concerned because that’s where this kind of technology is always first battle tested. One thing we know for sure is that people will be using the power of large language models to try to swing the election.”\n\nWhy are these models so good at language anyway? That’s one area there is a long history of research into, going back to ELIZA. If you’re curious about one of the people who’s been there for a lot of it (and performed no small amount of it himself), check out this profile on Stanford’s Christopher Manning. He was just awarded the John von Neuman Medal; congrats!\n\nIn a provocatively titled interview, another long-term AI researcher (who has graced the TechCrunch stage as well), Stuart Russell, and postdoc Michael Cohen speculate on “How to keep AI from killing us all.” Probably a good thing to figure out sooner rather than later! It’s not a superficial discussion, though — these are smart people talking about how we can actually understand the motivations (if that’s the right word) of AI models and how regulations ought to be built around them.\n\nThe interview is actually regarding a paper in Science published earlier this month, in which they propose that advanced AIs capable of acting strategically to achieve their goals, which they call “long-term planning agents,” may be impossible to test. Essentially, if a model learns to “understand” the testing it must pass in order to succeed, it may very well learn ways to creatively negate or circumvent that testing. We’ve seen it at a small scale, why not a large one?\n\nRussell proposes restricting the hardware needed to make such agents… but of course, Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs just got their deliveries. LANL just had the ribbon-cutting ceremony for Venado, a new supercomputer intended for AI research, composed of 2,560 Grace Hopper Nvidia chips.\n\nAnd Sandia just received “an extraordinary brain-based computing system called Hala Point,” with 1.15 billion artificial neurons, built by Intel and believed to be the largest such system in the world. Neuromorphic computing, as it’s called, isn’t intended to replace systems like Venado, but to pursue new methods of computation that are more brain-like than the rather statistics-focused approach we see in modern models.\n\n“With this billion-neuron system, we will have an opportunity to innovate at scale both new AI algorithms that may be more efficient and smarter than existing algorithms, and new brain-like approaches to existing computer algorithms such as optimization and modeling,” said Sandia researcher Brad Aimone. Sounds dandy… just dandy!",

There’s only one problem: the Llama 3 models aren’t really “open source,” at least not in the strictest definition. For example, Llama models can’t be used to train other models.

        "text": "Washington — In mid-April, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was on the ballot as an independent presidential candidate in Utah and Michigan, though his campaign says it is working to get him on the ballot in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nKennedy's backers insist he's not pursuing his White House bid just to hand the election to another candidate. They say he's the real deal and has a shot at winning the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidential election.\n\nGetting on the ballot in enough states to secure 270 votes — just over half the 538 votes in the Electoral College — is no small feat for a third-party contender. But it's possible.\n\n\"I think he has a very good chance of getting onto all 50 ballots,\" said Bernard Tamas, an associate professor of political science at Valdosta State University who studies third parties. \"The short answer is, I can't say definitively that he will, but it looks like he's on track for it.\"\n\nFile: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., during a campaign event in Oakland, California, on Tuesday, March 26, 2024. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nKennedy's campaign says it has completed signature gathering in seven other states in addition to Utah and Michigan — Nevada, Idaho, Hawaii, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Nebraska and Iowa.\n\nThe super PAC supporting Kennedy, American Values 2024, says it has collected enough signatures in Arizona, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nAnd yet, the campaign has yet to complete the paperwork and submit the petitions in those states. It noted that it still has months in most states to submit the paperwork because most states' deadlines aren't until July or August.\n\nThe campaign says it's trying to evade legal battles by picking the right time to hand in the petitions, holding onto the signatures until the 11th hour in hopes that the signatures will face fewer challenges.\n\nKennedy has already run into a paperwork snafu in Nevada. In March, the campaign learned that it would likely have to start the signature process all over again after failing to include a vice presidential candidate on the petition it used to collect signatures in the state.\n\n\"After successfully collecting all of the signatures we need in Nevada, the DNC Goon Squad and their lackeys in the Nevada Secretary of State's office are outright inventing a new requirement for the petition with zero legal basis,\" Kennedy campaign ballot access attorney Paul Rossi complained.\n\nIn addition to varying state regulations for ballot access and expensive legal battles, Kennedy faces opposition from Democratic groups aiming to undermine third-party campaigns.\n\nEarlier this year, the Democratic National Committee formed a team to challenge third-party and independent presidential candidates. The effort will depend on other groups like Third Way, MoveOn, and a new super PAC, Clear Choice, backed by allies of President Biden.\n\n\"Only two candidates have a path to 270 electoral votes — President Biden and Donald Trump,\" said DNC spokesperson Matt Corridoni. \"The stakes are high and we know this is going to be a close election. That's why a vote for any third-party candidate is a vote for Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe Kennedy campaign said it plans to secure ballot access in all 50 states, dismissing suggestions that Kennedy aims to help former President Donald Trump's bid for the presidency by taking votes from Mr. Biden.\n\n\"Our campaign is a spoiler. I agree with that. It's a spoiler for President Biden and for President Trump,\" Kennedy said when he revealed his running mate, Nicole Shanahan, last month.\n\nIn some states, the time frame for collecting signatures is brief. Others have provisions for signature thresholds to be reached in every county of a state. More than half the states require independent candidates to have a running mate.\n\nCollecting enough signatures isn't difficult in every state. Many only require 1,000 to 5,000 signatures, Tamas said. Louisiana requires no signatures and a $500 fee. Other states have higher thresholds. Texas requires over 113,000 signatures, and Florida requires more than 145,000.\n\nAnd those are the number of valid signatures required. Any third-party candidate needs to overshoot that target in order to make sure they have enough in case some of the signatures are found to be invalid.\n\nIn states like Hawaii, where the Kennedy campaign claims to have gathered enough signatures, it's more convenient to run under a party affiliation rather than as an independent candidate. Kennedy supporters are also collecting signatures in California, Mississippi, North Carolina and Delaware to establish the \"We The People\" party, which can then nominate Kennedy as its presidential candidate.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign says it's aiming to collect 60% over the signature threshold in each state.\n\n\"We have the field teams, volunteers, legal teams, paid circulators, supporters, and strategists ready to get the job done,\" said campaign press secretary Stefanie Spear. \"We are exceeding all our benchmarks and will be announcing new states each week.\"\n\nBut Tamas says Kennedy should be aiming higher — closer to double the required number of signatures.\n\n\"I'm surprised they're saying it's as low as 60, you just can't take any chances,\" Tamas said.\n\nCollecting signatures is expensive. Kennedy's super PAC estimates that it will cost around $40 to $50 million just to collect all the necessary signatures, although Tamas noted RFK Jr.'s running mate, Shanahan, the billionaire ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, has the financial resources.\n\nCollecting the signatures isn't the hardest part — it's the battle over the signatures that's the real fight, Tamas said. The Democratic Party will be fighting hard to invalidate Kennedy's signatures.\n\n\"You really have to prepare for a battle, so a lot of the cost is not actually getting the signatures, but actually the legal fees of fighting each state,\" Tamas said.\n\nDemocratic Party members are already trying to block Kennedy from getting on the ballot in Hawaii and Michigan.\n\nHistorically, there have been independent candidates who secured ballot access across nearly all states. In 1968, George Wallace, the former governor of Alabama, and in 1992, businessman Ross Perot both appeared on the ballot in all 50 states. Ralph Nader's candidacy in 2000 extended to 43 states.\n\nOnly Wallace managed to win any electoral votes. Perot's impressive 19% of the popular vote in 1992 did not translate to the Electoral College.\n\nPerot's former campaign manager, Russell Verney, said third-party candidates must overcome more obstacles today than in the past.\n\n\"Every time there's a reasonably successful independent candidate, the state legislatures, which are made up of Republicans and Democrats, who by definition do not like competition, increase the state barriers to getting on the ballot,\" Verney said. \"The requirements to get on these state ballots continues to get more onerous in every election cycle.\"\n\nBut \"someone in RFK's position, I don't think the Democrats are going to stop him,\" Tamas said. \"I think he's going to be on — if not all — then probably most of the ballots.\"\n\nA successful third-party candidate has to focus on individuals who aren't being represented by the major parties, Tamas said, and that's a problem for Kennedy.\n\n\"He's all over the place, and it's really not clear what's the disaffected group he's trying to tap into,\" Tamas said. \"He's running on conspiracy theories is part of it. But if someone's a conspiracy theorist, chances are they're going to support Donald Trump.\"\n\nAt this point, if Kennedy's ballot petitions were validated in all of the states where his website says the signature gathering is complete — Nevada, Hawaii, Idaho, Nebraska, Iowa, North Carolina and New Hampshire — plus Louisiana, which, as noted, does not have a signature requirement, and the two states where he is on the ballot — he could win 73 electoral votes. Add in the three states where his super PAC says it has the signatures, and that's another 36, putting him at 109.\n\nThe latest YouGov/Economist national polling shows Mr. Biden and Trump tied with 44% and Kennedy at 3%.\n\nKennedy's support is likely to drop off before November, Tamas predicted.\n\nBut it's not yet clear whether Mr. Biden or Trump stands to lose more from Kennedy's presidential bid.\n\n\"Nobody really knows for sure who he's going to take votes from,\" Tamas said.",

        "title": "I challenged myself to build a full Google ecosystem with less than $1,000. Here's how it went!",
        "text": "This is my Google ecosystem: phone, watch, headphones, audio, Chromecast. If I told you that you could get it all for under $1,000, I think a lot of people would be interested.\n\nLet me clarify right off the bat: Clearly, this isn’t possible if you focus on buying the latest and greatest Google hardware. When I thought about this challenge, I didn’t aim it for the biggest tech enthusiasts who want a Pixel 8 Pro or maybe even a Pixel tablet; they are just too expensive and would take up my entire $1,000 envelop and more! I wanted to maximize my budget and get as much as possible for as little money. However, I also didn’t want to go and get something like a Google Pixel 5 because that phone is too old now and nearing the end of its support.\n\nRita El Khoury / Android Authority\n\nSo, I gave myself a couple of caveats for this challenge: The stuff that I buy had to be supported for at least another two years. I couldn’t compromise on getting the latest and greatest from Google in terms of features. To try and get all of this for under that $1,000 budget, secondhand had to be my best friend. So eBay, Amazon renewed, and other retail options, depending on where you live. I focused on the US market and eBay.\n\nThe phone: Pixel 7a\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nLet’s start at the heart of any ecosystem that we’ll use every single day, and that is the phone. When you think about a budget phone from Google, your first thoughts turn to the Pixel 7a, the cheapest available phone at the moment. This is actually a really good starting point for our ecosystem. It’s only around one year old and with that latest Feature drop, it brings brand new features like Circle to Search to the 7a. The phone has a really good 6.1-inch display with a 90Hz refresh rate, so it feels like you aren’t massively missing out on Google’s best features and hardware.\n\nI did think about getting a cheap secondhand Pixel 8 or Pixel 7 Pro, but again, I had to get as much for as little as possible. The Pixel 7a gave me more wiggle room with the rest of my budget. Plus, it has a really slick always-on display and some decent cameras, including a 64MP main and a 13MP ultrawide, that stack up really well against the Pixel 7 and Pixel 8.\n\nThere are a few compromises with the Pixel 7a to keep in mind: the battery isn’t the best in the world, and the bezels are a little bit thick for 2024. But these are compromises that I can live with.\n\nGoing through eBay, I found a used Pixel 7a in excellent condition for about $250, so I went with it. Phone secured; what’s next?\n\nEarbuds and smartwatch: Pixel Buds Pro and Pixel Watch\n\nRita El Khoury / Android Authority\n\nWell, I needed to get some Bluetooth earbuds, too. For a budget ecosystem, I had two choices: the Pixel Buds A or the Pixel Buds Pro. The noise cancelation is a no-brainer requirement to me, so Pixel Buds Pro it is, even if the Buds A are cheaper. Plus, all around, the Buds Pro provide a much better experience, and we want a good experience despite our $1,000 budget.\n\nIf you’ve never used the Buds Pro before, I’ll tell you they are fantastic. They’re comfortable, the active noise cancelation is really good, the battery lasts up to 11 hours of listening, and they’ve got wireless charging. The Pixel Buds A don’t have that wireless charging and they only last about five hours of listening time.\n\nOverall, I just had to indulge and go Pro here, and thankfully, I didn’t have to break the bank to do it. I resigned myself to getting secondhand earbuds and decided to give them a thorough clean and buy new ear tips to avoid the previous owner’s ear gunk. A used pair of Pixel Buds Pro costs anywhere between $70 and $130 on eBay, so I bagged mine for $100.\n\nKaitlyn Cimino / Android Authority\n\nBut there’s another requirement I needed to elevate that ecosystem a little bit more, and that is a watch. You might think, “Oh, maybe I don’t need a Pixel Watch for that budget,” and yeah, it is something you could live without. But once I got the watch, I really realized how much it tied me into Google’s ecosystem. I could unlock my phone, see Google Maps navigation, and use Google Wallet without getting my phone out. It became so convenient and once I used it for a bit, I just felt like I couldn’t go back.\n\nAgain, I had a couple of options here. I could go with something like the Fitbit Sense 2, but I knew the best option was just a Pixel Watch. There aren’t loads of differences between the Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2. They’re both the same size and, essentially, the same design as well. A lot of the features that you get on the Watch 2 were recently added to the first-generation Pixel Watch. I wouldn’t be missing out on too much; things like skin temperature sensing, and stress notifications don’t stand out massively as big compromises to me.\n\nOnce I got the Pixel Watch, I really realized how much it tied me into Google's ecosystem.\n\nThe price difference would be the biggest roadblock to getting that Pixel Watch 2 because there’s about a $100 difference between the secondhand Watch 1 and 2. And obviously, if money weren’t an issue, then I’d get the Pixel Watch 2. But I do want to stretch my budget as much as possible. So, let’s get a Pixel Watch 1 instead. A secondhand unit goes from around $100 to $150. I got mine for $125.\n\nNow I have a Pixel 7a for $250, Pixel Buds Pro for $100, and a first-gen Pixel Watch for $125, which leaves me with $575 of my budget. And I could just stop there; that is actually a really good introduction to the Google ecosystem. But when you start to add smart home devices, that’s when the entire experience is elevated a step or two. I wanted to get things like Nest speakers and a Chromecast for under that $1,000 budget.\n\nA smart Google home: Chromecast, Nest Audio, Nest Hub\n\nRita El Khoury / Android Authority\n\nThe Chromecast has improved significantly over the past couple of years. Again, I had two options: an HD version and a 4K version. However, one of my biggest caveats at the start of this challenge was to future-proof everything for the next couple of years, so I had to exclude the Chromecast HD from the equation. Plus, 4K is probably your best friend here.\n\nI feel like the Chromecast 4K is so underrated as well. Some people might have a smart TV and think, “Well, I don’t need a Chromecast.” But smart TVs are really frustrating: You need to switch between apps constantly, they’re slow, and really just not intelligent at all. With the Chromecast interface, it’s just all in one place and it easily integrates with all of your devices, including the Pixel 7a that I got. You can even use your Pixel phone as a remote. So this is where I could clearly see the ecosystem start to come together.\n\nThe Chromecast 4K had to be the first product where I actually picked up a brand new unit rather than secondhand. Just look at the prices; when a new Chromecast is $59, there’s not a huge amount of savings to get with secondhand units. At least not enough to justify dealing with a used unit. A new one with the full warranty is a better deal. So I treated myself and went brand new with the Chromecast 4K from the Google store at $59.\n\nAdam Molina / Android Authority\n\nThe next thing I had to look at are Nest speakers. Again, a few options presented themselves: the second-generation Nest Mini, second-generation Nest Hub, and Nest Audio. You can pick up Nest Minis for a ridiculously low price on eBay, but I had to remember that they’ve been around since 2019. And while they’re still getting updates five years down the line, I don’t think they’re futureproof enough. On top of that, the sound isn’t actually that great. So my best bet was that Nest Audio.\n\nThe Nest Audio came out in 2020, a year later than the second-generation Nest Mini. It sounds infinitely better, and even though it costs a little bit more secondhand, it wouldn’t blow past my remaining budget. If you get more than one Nest Audio, the sound quality is even more elevated, as you can create a stereo pair for a more immersive listening experience.\n\nGoing through eBay, secondhand Nest Audio units range in price a bit. But I found a listing where I could get them for $50 each. Given the affordable price, I went with two so I could actually have that stereo pair.\n\nNest and Chromecast aren't essential to the Pixel lifestyle, but they add a little something extra.\n\nWith a decent budget left, I decided to treat myself to something else and take my Pixel and Google experience to the next level. I went for a Nest Hub, and I love it. It sits on my bedside table and lets me also see what Google Assistant is trying to babble on about. Weather, smart Google Home controls, watching YouTube, and seeing Google Photos at a glance; all of these are things the Nest Hub 2nd Generation is capable of while tying more of my Google ecosystem together. Plus, it doesn’t cost a huge amount of money.\n\nIf you go through eBay, you’ll see that these are really well-priced as secondhand units at about $70 to $80. And if you search well enough, you can find one for around $70, like the one I got. And yes, the Nest Hub did come out a couple of years ago, but it’s still very much getting software updates and should continue to, at least for the next couple of years.\n\nA full Google ecosystem for just over $700!\n\nRita El Khoury / Android Authority\n\nLet’s go through what I got. I have a $250 Google Pixel 7a, a $100 pair of Pixel Buds Pro, the first-generation Pixel Watch for $125, a new $59 Chromecast 4K, two Nest Audios for $100 total, and a Nest Hub 2nd Generation for $70. If you add all this together, my intro into the Google ecosystem cost me just over $700 — $704, to be exact. And besides going for secondhand units, I’m getting a really good experience as a first dabble into Google’s ecosystem and not making any huge compromises.\n\nIn fact, I could go on and keep adding to this if I wanted to spend all of my $1,000 budget. Maybe buy a secondhand Pixel Tablet, a Nest Doorbell, or switch to a more powerful Google Pixel. But I think I’m good with my current setup, and I’ve got a decent amount of change left for future upgrades or items!\n\nI really enjoyed this challenge because I didn’t think I’d be able to stretch my budget this much and get as many pillars for my Google experience as I did. What do you think of my choices for this Google ecosystem challenge? Would you make similar compromises and choices? Would you skip some of these items or would you indulge in something extra?\n\nComments",
        "summary": "This is my Google ecosystem: phone, watch, headphones, audio, Chromecast. When I thought about this challenge, I didn’t aim it for the biggest tech enthusiasts who want a Pixel 8 Pro or maybe even a Pixel tablet; they are just too expensive and would take up my entire $1,000 envelop and more! I couldn’t compromise on getting the latest and greatest from Google in terms of features. To try and get all of this for under that $1,000 budget, secondhand had to be my best friend. The phone: Pixel 7a\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nLet’s start at the heart of any ecosystem that we’ll use every single day, and that is the phone. This is actually a really good starting point for our ecosystem. But these are compromises that I can live with. But once I got the watch, I really realized how much it tied me into Google’s ecosystem. They’re both the same size and, essentially, the same design as well. I wouldn’t be missing out on too much; things like skin temperature sensing, and stress notifications don’t stand out massively as big compromises to me. Now I have a Pixel 7a for $250, Pixel Buds Pro for $100, and a first-gen Pixel Watch for $125, which leaves me with $575 of my budget. I feel like the Chromecast 4K is so underrated as well. Some people might have a smart TV and think, “Well, I don’t need a Chromecast.” At least not enough to justify dealing with a used unit. You can pick up Nest Minis for a ridiculously low price on eBay, but I had to remember that they’ve been around since 2019. The Nest Audio came out in 2020, a year later than the second-generation Nest Mini. Given the affordable price, I went with two so I could actually have that stereo pair. And if you search well enough, you can find one for around $70, like the one I got. A full Google ecosystem for just over $700! Would you skip some of these items or would you indulge in something extra?"

        "title": "5 reasons your Mac might be running slow",
        "text": "If your Mac is running slow, there are a few things you can do to speed it up and better understand what’s slowing it down.\n\nIt’s not just that your Mac is old — although that is an important factor. It could be that you don’t have enough memory, especially if you like to use Google Chrome. You may have a bunch of apps running in the background. There also might be dust in the vents, keeping your Mac from running nice and cool.\n\nCheck out our latest video or keep reading to learn why your Mac is slow and how to speed it up.\n\n\n\nThis post contains affiliate links. Cult of Mac may earn a commission when you use our links to buy items.\n\n5 reasons for a slow Mac\n\n1. Switch from Google Chrome (and other apps) to Safari\n\nSafari is much easier on your Mac than Google Chrome, which is a notorious power drain and memory hog. The more Chrome tabs you have open, the less memory you have available for everything else.\n\nSafari consistently comes out on top of browser speed tests. According to Apple, Safari loads pages up to 50% faster than Chrome. So, switching to Safari from Chrome is an easy way to speed up your slow Mac. (Making the switch also gives you a security boost, especially if you max out Safari’s privacy settings.)\n\nIt’s not just Google Chrome itself, either. Apps like Slack, Discord, Spotify, Microsoft Teams and many others are made using the Chrome browser engine, too. But there’s a solution to this problem: Instead of using the official versions of those apps, you can open them and sign in from Safari, then click File > Add to Dock.\n\nThen you’ll be able to run your web apps in their own windows, just like before, but with the energy-efficient Safari powering them instead.\n\n2. Check what apps are running in the background on your slow Mac\n\nIt’s good to keep an eye on what’s running in the background, especially if your Mac is running slow. It could be that you’ve installed a bunch of apps over the years, and one of them is still churning away in the background even though you never use it.\n\nYou can find this information in System Settings > General > Login Items.\n\nOn top, you’ll see apps that launch automatically when you sign in to your Mac. You can click to select one and click the − button to remove it. Below, you’ll see a list of apps allowed to run in the background. Simply uncheck them to turn them off.\n\nOther background activities are built into macOS itself. There’s no easy way to turn them off without digging into the Terminal, but you should be aware of them:\n\nIf you sync your photo library to your Mac, it’ll download new pictures and videos in the background and scan through them to identify people and pets.\n\nSpotlight, the universal search box that can find files, apps, messages, email and more, occasionally needs to scan your Mac to find if there’s anything new.\n\n3. Your slow Mac is simply too old\n\nMacs last a really, really long time — and that’s both a blessing and a curse. I used my 2015 MacBook Pro for eight years, even as its battery started swelling. Now, it’s probably a fire hazard.\n\nApple releases a major new version of macOS every year. And updating can make an older Mac run slowly. If you keep using an older version (while still installing Apple’s minor security updates), your Mac might run a little faster. (Or, at least, stop getting slower.) Major new releases with new features can slow down an older computer.\n\nToward the end of the period when Apple sold computers with Intel chips — let’s say from 2014 to 2020 — there were some pretty bad Macs. The 2014 to 2018 Mac mini is legitimately one of the worst Macs ever made. If you own one of those, I’m sorry.\n\nThe good news is that new Macs with Apple silicon chips inside are lightning-fast and relatively inexpensive. Walmart sells the M1 MacBook Air for just $699. And if you want to save more with a desktop, you can pick up an M1 Mac mini for around $500.\n\n4. Your Mac is overheating\n\nIf your Mac starts getting warm, it will automatically slow down (aka “throttle”) the processor to keep it from getting too hot. Normally, your Mac will only throttle itself if you’re doing something really intense, like exporting a video. It can be frustrating if your Mac slows down in the middle of your regular work.\n\nIn an older MacBook, the vents can become blocked by dust over time and cause overheating. That’s pretty easy to fix. Carefully unscrew and remove the MacBook’s bottom case. Then use a vacuum cleaner or a can of compressed air to clear out all the visible dust.\n\nIn ordinary usage, it’s rare for a newer MacBook Air with Apple silicon to be pushed to its limits, but it can still happen. Since these laptops doesn’t come with an internal fan, you can boost their performance with a cooling pad.\n\nThis model sold on Amazon costs only $25. When you’re at your desk, you can put your MacBook on top of it. The cooling pad’s fans will keep cool air blowing underneath, where a MacBook Air gets the hottest. This particular cooling pad doubles as a USB hub, so plugging it into your Mac gives you two USB ports as well.\n\n5. You don’t have enough memory (or storage)\n\nMost Macs made in the last 10 years start with just 8GB of memory on the base model. Upgrading to 16GB or more is one of the most important upgrades you can make when buying a Mac, but a lot of people skip it. You can upgrade the RAM on some older Macs, but not on any recent ones running on Apple silicon.\n\nThe bad news is, if you have too many apps open at once, other apps you have open will be pushed out of memory. And that can really make your Mac run slowly if you’re trying to multitask. Short of splurging on extra memory with your next Mac, unfortunately, the only solution when this happens is to quit big apps you’re not using.\n\nThis problem can be compounded if your Mac is running low on storage, too. Usually, when your Mac is running low on memory, background apps will be offloaded into storage — but if you don’t have enough storage, that can cause more problems. Here’s what to do if you need to clear up space on your Mac.\n\nRead more about your Mac\n\nCheck out more Mac tips:",

        "text": "Are you searching for some new app recommendations for your smartphone? If so, you're in luck because we have compiled a list of the top 5 apps of the week. Whether you enjoy gaming or need useful tools, our editorial team at nextpit has carefully selected and tested five exciting options for both iPhone and Android users. Let's dive in!\n\nThis week we will take a look at a café management game, a useful temporary email app, a habit tracker and journal, and a couple of apps that are meant only for Android devices—a keyboard and an app that relies on gestures to help you navigate a large screen device easily.\n\nMany apps these days include in-app purchases or ads. However, we carefully test all apps to ensure fairness and to protect you from unexpected costs. Our main goal is to find apps that enhance your smartphone experience and provide additional benefits.\n\nIf you're interested in finding app deals, don't forget to explore our selection of free apps of the week! Every week, we showcase a collection of apps that are usually paid but currently available for free as part of a promotional offer. Now, let's dive into our top 5 apps for this week and discover the best mobile games and apps that made the cut!\n\nHappy Dessert Café (Android & iOS)\n\nThere are tons of café management games in abundance, so what makes Happy Dessert Café different from the rest? Well, while this game is still replete with video ads which can be avoided with microtransactions, there is merit to recommending it. It boasts adorable graphics and is well-developed, featuring many areas in the game to keep you occupied.\n\nPrice: Free / Advertising: Yes / In-app purchases: Yes / Account required: No\n\nDo take note that there is no limit on the number of ads you can watch, and watching one will let you earn satisfying rewards. Among them include the energy bar being filled to the brim, doubling the amount of in-game currency you can claim, among others. Ultimately, this game has just one aim: For you to be the best dessert café in town!\n\nDownload HappyDessert Café from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nIt is strangely therapeutic at times, when a lot of the gameplay becomes muscle memory. The kawaii graphics and soothing soundtrack certainly add to the overall charm. What's more, you will be able to unlock a cat café if you progress far enough in the game. What's there not to like about a cat café?\n\nTemp Mail (Android & iOS)\n\nI absolutely detest it when I am required to share my email whenever I want to read an article on a website or use a particular online service. While the terms and conditions tend to promise not to sell my personal details to other third parties, I raise an eyebrow at such claims because not long after, my inbox will be peppered with spam. Enter the Temp Mail app.\n\nThis app allows me to generate instant email addresses that are disposable. In other words, it lives up to its namesake by providing me with temporary email addresses, letting me receive photos and other attachments without having to reveal my real email to all and sundry.\n\nPrice: Free / Advertising: Yes / In-app purchases: Yes ($2.99/week, $7.99/month, $58.99/annual) / Account required: No\n\nTime to hit back at spammers and pesky online sites that want your data! / © nextpit\n\nDownload Temp Mail from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nI have tried using this for a week, and found it to be extremely helpful. While this is anecdotal, I think I have successfully reduced the amount of advertising mails and spam into my inbox thanks to the liberal use of Temp Mail. The random email addresses are simply a mishmash of letters and numbers, but if you want something customizable by editing it, you can do so with a premium account.\n\nI love how Temp Mail allows me to perform autofill in apps and forms as well using this temporary email address. 30 different languages are supported to provide excellent support for users worldwide. You can even generate a QR code for others to scan.\n\nHelloHabit (Android & iOS)\n\nThey say you need to do something for three weeks straight before it becomes a habit. In this fast-paced world, time becomes a premium, and it can be extremely challenging to develop a habit. Thankfully, there are apps like HelloHabit to help the procrastinator out. While this app might be helpful, it could also be considered frustrating. At its core, HelloHabit is a habit-building app that is handy to help remind you to stay on target so that the necessary evils tasks get done.\n\nHelloHabit makes it easier to create habits in a meaningful and easy manner. / © nextpit\n\nPrice: Free / Advertising: No / In-app purchases: Yes ($1.99/month, $9.99/annual) / Account required: No\n\nI love how the developer designed the user interface. It is highly intuitive and effortless to use, which is one of the key ingredients to getting people to use your app. What more for an app that is meant to be used daily. You can select from various views that make it easier to get an overview of how much have you accomplished with each passing week.\n\nThere is only one drawback that I would like to highlight here: the free tier can only track three habits, offering a limited number of journal entries and scheduled events. If you want to gain unlimited access, then there is a subscription fee to fork out.\n\nDownload HelloHabit from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nUnexpected Keyboard (Android)\n\nHow fast are you when it comes to typing with your smartphone keyboard? Well, Unexpected Keyboard will take some getting used to with its rather unusual method of typing. It is simple to use and does not infringe on your privacy, while offering a fairly intuitive manner of accessing symbols and emojis with fewer steps.\n\nHassle-free typing on your smartphone's virtual keyboard with this lightweight and simple app. / © nextpit\n\nPrice: Free / Advertising: None / In-app purchases: None / Account required: No\n\nWhat do I mean by this? You see, there are different symbols/numbers at the corners of certain keys. Slide your thumb toward the corner of said key and the corresponding symbol/number will be typed. As mentioned earlier, there is a slight learning curve to using this keyboard, but I believe you will be messaging like a boss in no time at all.\n\nDownload Unexpected Keyboard from the Google Play Store.\n\nHere's a word of caution for those who have long gotten used to Gboard and/or Swiftkey. This app will most probably find niche users due to the limited functionality. For starters, it has no autocomplete, it misses out on a clipboard that allows you to copy and paste, and there is a lack of theme support. Thankfully, in terms of security, it works for me since there is no need to be connected to the Internet to use it and asks for only two permissions on my device.\n\nMicro Gesture (Android)\n\nI wonder just how much of Pavlov's principle have we humans attuned ourselves to when it comes to using our smartphones. What if I told you there is a brand-new way to use your handset? Imagine being able to access your favorite app simply by pressing the Volume Up or Power button.\n\nWhat if you have incoming notifications that you want to view? Just tilt the handset to the left, and the notification pane will drop. This is precisely what Micro Gesture does—offer you a whole new way of interacting with your smartphone.\n\nPrice: Free / Advertising: No / In-app purchases: No / Account required: No\n\nYou will find yourself using your smartphone like a boss with these built-in scripted gestures! / © nextpit\n\nAs smartphones get larger, using it with just a single hand becomes more and more difficult. In fact, it is downright impossible for some people, considering the heft of the device itself. Still, there are some handsets out there that can be operated with just one hand, so why not make use of Micro Gesture to help you make the most of it?\n\nDownload Micro Gesture from the Google Play Store.\n\nThis app relies on your handset's gyroscopes to recognize minute movements, improving the operating experience of large-screen smartphones. You can rotate the phone along three axes and assign a customizable action to each axis. It is highly customizable with an adjustable motion sensitivity slider, offering optional vibration or text feedback to boot. When you're more comfortable with it, feel free to explore the different automated scripts for a more productive user experience.\n\nDid you discover an exciting new app this week? If so, why not let us know and share it with the nextpit community? You can do so in the comments!",

        "title": "Dell XPS 14 (9440)",
        "text": "Dell's consumer flagship XPS laptops always flaunt an extra-fancy feature or two. (We're glad these days it's an LED touch-strip key row instead of a webcam aimed up your nose.) The new XPS 14 (model 9440, starting at $1,699; $2,099 as tested) shows off the flashy top row and seamless haptic touchpad that premiered in the Dell XPS 13 Plus, plus Intel's latest AI-enhanced silicon and Microsoft's dedicated key for AI-enhanced Windows Copilot. The Dell XPS 14 is a sleek and swift performer, but its only advantages over other slimline laptops are a barely larger 14.5-inch display and an optional discrete GPU for more content-creation performance. With that, the Asus Zenbook 14X OLED (UX3404) remains our Editors' Choice award holder for high-end ultraportable laptops, while Asus' own Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406) presents a similar experience for half the XPS 14's price.\n\nConfigurations and Design: Meteor Lake or Bust\n\nWhile Intel's Core Ultra 7 155H is the only processor choice you have at checkout, our review unit has the $400-extra 6GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 in place of the standard Intel Arc integrated graphics. Otherwise, this unit has base-model specs with 16GB of memory, a 512GB NVMe solid-state drive, Windows 11 Home, and an IPS screen with a 1,920-by-1,200-pixel resolution and variable 60Hz or 120Hz refresh rate (no touch control here). A tempting $300 OLED touch panel with a 3,200-by-2,000-pixel resolution is available as an option.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe XPS 14's memory- and storage-ceiling options are dense (64GB and 4TB respectively). Relatively speaking, so is the laptop's body, weighing 3.7 pounds (3.8 for OLED models), offsetting its trim size of 0.71 by 12.6 by 8.5 inches. By contrast, the HP Pavilion Plus 14 hits the scale at 3.04 pounds, and the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch qualifies as an ultraportable at 2.82 pounds.\n\nCrafted from CNC machined aluminum in either Graphite (black) or Platinum, the Dell exhibits almost no flex if you torque the screen corners or press the keyboard deck. What the company calls an InfinityEdge display has fashion-model-thin bezels, though I was dismayed that the webcam centered above the screen has neither a sliding privacy shutter nor a keyboard camera-kill command. The camera has IR face recognition, which coupled with a fingerprint-reader power button gives you two ways to skip typing passwords with Windows Hello.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nLike other Dell XPS notebooks, not to mention Apple Macbooks, the XPS 14 relies on USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports—two on the left edge and one on the right, the latter joined by an audio jack (shamefully missing from the Dell XPS 13) and a microSD card slot.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe laptop lacks USB Type-A and HDMI monitor ports, but you get one of each on a clever little dongle that, like the AC adapter, plugs into a USB-C port. You'll find no mobile broadband option here, but Intel Killer Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth come standard.\n\nUsing the Dell XPS 14: An Invisible Touchpad\n\nAs on the XPS 13 Plus, the XPS 14 keyboard is a voguish lattice, a rectangle sliced into flush-fitting squares instead of raised or separate keys. Even when its backlighting is turned off, the top row of LED icons is illuminated. Along with the Escape and Delete keys as well as volume and brightness controls, the row includes Home and End keys, though Page Up and Page Down are combinations of the Fn key and up and down cursor arrows. These arrow keys are sadly half-size keys stacked between full-size left and right arrows, in the awkward row instead of the proper inverted T that I always complain about in HP laptop reviews.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nDell's keyboard looks better than it feels: It's quiet and responsive but noticeably shallow and stiff. I make more than my usual amount of errors with these keys, and they would be uncomfortable to type on for hours. By contrast, the seamless glass touchpad was friendlier than I expected; it's placed so that muscle memory proves quite accurate for right-clicking (a tap at the bottom right), and it has a comfortable haptic click.\n\nThe webcam records in 1080p resolution and supports the recently added Windows Studio Effects for automatic framing, eye-contact adjustment, and background blurring. It's an above-average camera, capturing well-lit images even on a dark overcast day; we noted vivid color and no annoying noise or static.\n\nDell's entry-level IPS screen is impressively bright, with clean white backgrounds, though it doesn't tilt back quite as far as I'd like. The display's colors are rich and well-saturated, and it shows decently deep contrast and wide viewing angles. The screen's details are sharp with no pixelation around the edges of letters.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nPreinstalled on the system, the MyDell app works with the webcam to provide presence detection, locking and waking the PC as you walk away and return. This duo also protects your privacy by dimming the screen if you look away. MyDell also lets you fine-tune screen color tweaks such as gamma and temperature; choose optimized, quiet, or high-performance modes for cooling and fan noise; and launch a Killer networking dashboard to prioritize traffic for different apps and choose the strongest available Wi-Fi access point.\n\nOne more MyDell feature lets you toggle 3D audio effects and pick from equalizer profiles ranging from acoustic and jazz to metal and hip-hop. A set of 8-watt quad speakers pumps out loud but rather hollow audio. You'll hear a bit more bass than most laptops can muster, but drumbeats sound flat—at least it's easy to make out overlapping tracks.\n\nTesting the Dell XPS 14: Dedicated Graphics Don't Always Dazzle\n\nWhile the XPS 14 stands alone with a 14.5-inch display, you'll find plenty of 14-inch competitors on both sides of the 3-pound line that serves as our ultraportable cutoff. The Lenovo Slim 7i 14 Gen 9 and the Acer Swift Go 14 join the Dell in housing an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H CPU and a 1,920-by-1,200-pixel screen, though the Lenovo laptop has OLED instead of IPS tech. The abovementioned HP Pavilion Plus 14 and Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406) rely on AMD Ryzen instead of Intel processors.\n\nProductivity Tests\n\nWe run the same general productivity benchmarks across both mobile and desktop systems. Our first test is UL's PCMark 10, which simulates a variety of real-world productivity and office workflows to measure overall system performance and also includes a storage subtest for the primary drive.\n\nThree more benchmarks focus on the CPU, using all available cores and threads, to rate a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Maxon's Cinebench R23 uses that company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene, while Geekbench 5.5 Pro from Primate Labs simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning. We also use the open-source video transcoder HandBrake 1.4 to convert a 12-minute video clip from 4K to 1080p resolution (lower times are better).\n\nFinally, we run PugetBench for Photoshop by workstation maker Puget Systems, which uses the Creative Cloud version 22 of Adobe's famous image editor to rate a PC's performance for content creation and multimedia applications. It's an automated extension that executes a variety of general and GPU-accelerated Photoshop tasks ranging from opening, rotating, resizing, and saving an image to applying masks, gradient fills, and filters.\n\nAll five slimlines easily cleared the 4,000 points in PCMark 10, signaling excellent mainstream productivity for Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace. The XPS 14 performed well enough in our CPU tests and posted a competitive score in Photoshop; it's not meant for demanding workstation apps but is a fine choice as a daily driver.\n\nHowever, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch edged out the XPS 14 in several tests here, pointing toward competitive processing performance from AMD in this latest generation. Even more important, however, is that this Zenbook kept up with the XPS 14 for less than half the price at just $800 at the time of writing.\n\nGraphics Tests\n\nWe test each Windows PC's graphics with two DirectX 12 gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark, Night Raid (more modest, suitable for laptops with integrated graphics) and Time Spy (more demanding, suitable for gaming rigs with discrete GPUs).\n\nAdditionally, we run two tests from the cross-platform GPU benchmark GFXBench 5, which stresses both low-level routines like texturing and high-level, game-like image rendering. The 1440p Aztec Ruins and 1080p Car Chase tests are rendered offscreen to accommodate different display resolutions as well as exercise graphics and compute shaders using the OpenGL programming interface and hardware tessellation, respectively. The more frames per second (fps), the better.\n\nThe Dell's GeForce GPU predictably outran its rivals' integrated graphics in three of our four tests, though it laid down and died in Night Raid—a baffling lapse, since I tried the benchmark several times and configured Windows to use the RTX 4050 instead of Intel Arc Graphics. The others were hollow victories, with the XPS 14 underperforming by discrete-graphics standards, possibly because Dell's specs say the GPU is tuned to a tiny 30W.\n\nThis GPU wattage and performance weakens one of the Dell XPS 14's advantages as a nearly ultraportable laptop for creators. It should be enough to drive photo editing work, which might be this laptop's niche focus, but more intense visual work, like video editing and 3D content creation, would be better served by a higher-wattage chip.\n\nBattery and Display Tests\n\nWe test each laptop's battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie Tears of Steel) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test, with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off.\n\nTo gauge display performance, we also use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and its Windows software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation—what percentage of the sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show—and its 50% and peak brightness in nits (candelas per square meter).\n\nThe XPS almost tied the Zenbook for the win in our battery rundown, with more than enough stamina to get you through an all-day workday. It joined the other IPS system, the Acer, in trailing the OLED displays but showed suitable color coverage for anything short of pre-press or professional graphics, and it was the brightest screen in the testing quintet.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nVerdict: High Fashion, High Price\n\nDell doesn't make bad laptops, and the XPS 14 is an attractive, even elegant productivity partner with epic battery life. Unfortunately, it doesn't contend for Editors' Choice honors. Comparing base model with base model, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch crushes it on value. The Zenbook provides more-vivid color and contrast (with OLED versus IPS screen technology); it performs about as well, short of graphics tasks; it's about a pound lighter; and it costs $900 less. (Likewise, Asus fills the high-end ultraportable Editors' Choice slot with its still slightly cheaper Zenbook 14X OLED.) If you need an ultraportable laptop for photo editing specifically and little else creatively, then maybe the XPS 14 is a fit for you. Otherwise, Asus and even Apple have more affordable alternatives for that performance niche.",

        "title": "Dell XPS 14 (9440)",
        "text": "Dell's consumer flagship XPS laptops always flaunt an extra-fancy feature or two. (We're glad these days it's an LED touch-strip key row instead of a webcam aimed up your nose.) The new XPS 14 (model 9440, starting at $1,699; $2,099 as tested) shows off the flashy top row and seamless haptic touchpad that premiered in the Dell XPS 13 Plus, plus Intel's latest AI-enhanced silicon and Microsoft's dedicated key for AI-enhanced Windows Copilot. The Dell XPS 14 is a sleek and swift performer, but its only advantages over other slimline laptops are a barely larger 14.5-inch display and an optional discrete GPU for more content-creation performance. With that, the Asus Zenbook 14X OLED (UX3404) remains our Editors' Choice award holder for high-end ultraportable laptops, while Asus' own Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406) presents a similar experience for half the XPS 14's price.\n\nConfigurations and Design: Meteor Lake or Bust\n\nWhile Intel's Core Ultra 7 155H is the only processor choice you have at checkout, our review unit has the $400-extra 6GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 in place of the standard Intel Arc integrated graphics. Otherwise, this unit has base-model specs with 16GB of memory, a 512GB NVMe solid-state drive, Windows 11 Home, and an IPS screen with a 1,920-by-1,200-pixel resolution and variable 60Hz or 120Hz refresh rate (no touch control here). A tempting $300 OLED touch panel with a 3,200-by-2,000-pixel resolution is available as an option.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe XPS 14's memory- and storage-ceiling options are dense (64GB and 4TB respectively). Relatively speaking, so is the laptop's body, weighing 3.7 pounds (3.8 for OLED models), offsetting its trim size of 0.71 by 12.6 by 8.5 inches. By contrast, the HP Pavilion Plus 14 hits the scale at 3.04 pounds, and the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch qualifies as an ultraportable at 2.82 pounds.\n\nCrafted from CNC machined aluminum in either Graphite (black) or Platinum, the Dell exhibits almost no flex if you torque the screen corners or press the keyboard deck. What the company calls an InfinityEdge display has fashion-model-thin bezels, though I was dismayed that the webcam centered above the screen has neither a sliding privacy shutter nor a keyboard camera-kill command. The camera has IR face recognition, which coupled with a fingerprint-reader power button gives you two ways to skip typing passwords with Windows Hello.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nLike other Dell XPS notebooks, not to mention Apple Macbooks, the XPS 14 relies on USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports—two on the left edge and one on the right, the latter joined by an audio jack (shamefully missing from the Dell XPS 13) and a microSD card slot.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nThe laptop lacks USB Type-A and HDMI monitor ports, but you get one of each on a clever little dongle that, like the AC adapter, plugs into a USB-C port. You'll find no mobile broadband option here, but Intel Killer Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth come standard.\n\nUsing the Dell XPS 14: An Invisible Touchpad\n\nAs on the XPS 13 Plus, the XPS 14 keyboard is a voguish lattice, a rectangle sliced into flush-fitting squares instead of raised or separate keys. Even when its backlighting is turned off, the top row of LED icons is illuminated. Along with the Escape and Delete keys as well as volume and brightness controls, the row includes Home and End keys, though Page Up and Page Down are combinations of the Fn key and up and down cursor arrows. These arrow keys are sadly half-size keys stacked between full-size left and right arrows, in the awkward row instead of the proper inverted T that I always complain about in HP laptop reviews.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nDell's keyboard looks better than it feels: It's quiet and responsive but noticeably shallow and stiff. I make more than my usual amount of errors with these keys, and they would be uncomfortable to type on for hours. By contrast, the seamless glass touchpad was friendlier than I expected; it's placed so that muscle memory proves quite accurate for right-clicking (a tap at the bottom right), and it has a comfortable haptic click.\n\nThe webcam records in 1080p resolution and supports the recently added Windows Studio Effects for automatic framing, eye-contact adjustment, and background blurring. It's an above-average camera, capturing well-lit images even on a dark overcast day; we noted vivid color and no annoying noise or static.\n\nDell's entry-level IPS screen is impressively bright, with clean white backgrounds, though it doesn't tilt back quite as far as I'd like. The display's colors are rich and well-saturated, and it shows decently deep contrast and wide viewing angles. The screen's details are sharp with no pixelation around the edges of letters.\n\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)\n\nPreinstalled on the system, the MyDell app works with the webcam to provide presence detection, locking and waking the PC as you walk away and return. This duo also protects your privacy by dimming the screen if you look away. MyDell also lets you fine-tune screen color tweaks such as gamma and temperature; choose optimized, quiet, or high-performance modes for cooling and fan noise; and launch a Killer networking dashboard to prioritize traffic for different apps and choose the strongest available Wi-Fi access point.\n\nOne more MyDell feature lets you toggle 3D audio effects and pick from equalizer profiles ranging from acoustic and jazz to metal and hip-hop. A set of 8-watt quad speakers pumps out loud but rather hollow audio. You'll hear a bit more bass than most laptops can muster, but drumbeats sound flat—at least it's easy to make out overlapping tracks.\n\nTesting the Dell XPS 14: Dedicated Graphics Don't Always Dazzle\n\nWhile the XPS 14 stands alone with a 14.5-inch display, you'll find plenty of 14-inch competitors on both sides of the 3-pound line that serves as our ultraportable cutoff. The Lenovo Slim 7i 14 Gen 9 and the Acer Swift Go 14 join the Dell in housing an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H CPU and a 1,920-by-1,200-pixel screen, though the Lenovo laptop has OLED instead of IPS tech. The abovementioned HP Pavilion Plus 14 and Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406) rely on AMD Ryzen instead of Intel processors.\n\nProductivity Tests\n\nWe run the same general productivity benchmarks across both mobile and desktop systems. Our first test is UL's PCMark 10, which simulates a variety of real-world productivity and office workflows to measure overall system performance and also includes a storage subtest for the primary drive.\n\nThree more benchmarks focus on the CPU, using all available cores and threads, to rate a PC's suitability for processor-intensive workloads. Maxon's Cinebench R23 uses that company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene, while Geekbench 5.5 Pro from Primate Labs simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning. We also use the open-source video transcoder HandBrake 1.4 to convert a 12-minute video clip from 4K to 1080p resolution (lower times are better).\n\nFinally, we run PugetBench for Photoshop by workstation maker Puget Systems, which uses the Creative Cloud version 22 of Adobe's famous image editor to rate a PC's performance for content creation and multimedia applications. It's an automated extension that executes a variety of general and GPU-accelerated Photoshop tasks ranging from opening, rotating, resizing, and saving an image to applying masks, gradient fills, and filters.\n\nAll five slimlines easily cleared the 4,000 points in PCMark 10, signaling excellent mainstream productivity for Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace. The XPS 14 performed well enough in our CPU tests and posted a competitive score in Photoshop; it's not meant for demanding workstation apps but is a fine choice as a daily driver.\n\nHowever, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch edged out the XPS 14 in several tests here, pointing toward competitive processing performance from AMD in this latest generation. Even more important, however, is that this Zenbook kept up with the XPS 14 for less than half the price at just $800 at the time of writing.\n\nGraphics Tests\n\nWe test each Windows PC's graphics with two DirectX 12 gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark, Night Raid (more modest, suitable for laptops with integrated graphics) and Time Spy (more demanding, suitable for gaming rigs with discrete GPUs).\n\nAdditionally, we run two tests from the cross-platform GPU benchmark GFXBench 5, which stresses both low-level routines like texturing and high-level, game-like image rendering. The 1440p Aztec Ruins and 1080p Car Chase tests are rendered offscreen to accommodate different display resolutions as well as exercise graphics and compute shaders using the OpenGL programming interface and hardware tessellation, respectively. The more frames per second (fps), the better.\n\nThe Dell's GeForce GPU predictably outran its rivals' integrated graphics in three of our four tests, though it laid down and died in Night Raid—a baffling lapse, since I tried the benchmark several times and configured Windows to use the RTX 4050 instead of Intel Arc Graphics. The others were hollow victories, with the XPS 14 underperforming by discrete-graphics standards, possibly because Dell's specs say the GPU is tuned to a tiny 30W.\n\nThis GPU wattage and performance weakens one of the Dell XPS 14's advantages as a nearly ultraportable laptop for creators. It should be enough to drive photo editing work, which might be this laptop's niche focus, but more intense visual work, like video editing and 3D content creation, would be better served by a higher-wattage chip.\n\nBattery and Display Tests\n\nWe test each laptop's battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie Tears of Steel) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test, with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off.\n\nTo gauge display performance, we also use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and its Windows software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation—what percentage of the sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show—and its 50% and peak brightness in nits (candelas per square meter).\n\nThe XPS almost tied the Zenbook for the win in our battery rundown, with more than enough stamina to get you through an all-day workday.

        "text": "A massive effort to 'hand-map' undocumented roads has revealed the staggering extent of illegal or informal thoroughfares cut through forests of Indonesia, Malaysia, and New Guinea.\n\nUsing satellite imagery, researchers from Australia and Indonesia measured 1.37 million kilometers (851,000 miles) of thoroughfare – between three and seven times longer than the roads officially recorded in international databases for the same land area.\n\nWithin the surrounds of these missing 'ghost roads', they found, deforestation skyrocketed.\n\nIt's a troubling discovery from just one part of the world, Southeast Asia, which contains the largest combined expanse of tropical rainforest outside the Amazon and the Congo Basin.\n\nAnd it comes at a time when the world really needs to be reining in deforestation to meet its biodiversity protection targets and avoid dangerous tipping points that could unleash catastrophic consequences if passed.\n\n\"Collectively, our findings suggest that burgeoning, poorly studied ghost roads are among the gravest of all direct threats to tropical forests,\" James Cook University applied ecologist Jayden Engert and colleagues write in their published paper.\n\nAll up, it took the researchers and their team of 210 trained volunteers more than 7,000 hours to manually map roads they could spot on Google Earth satellite imagery of some 1.4 million square kilometers (more than 540,000 square miles) of land in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nTheir analysis revealed a vast network of roads crisscrossing the islands of Borneo, Sumatra, and New Guinea. These roads measured 1.37 million kilometers in total length – between 3 and 6.6 times more than what is recorded in two international databases.\n\nIn some places, Engert told Carolyn Cowan of Mongabay, those databases had mapped less than 5 percent of the roads the eagle-eyed researchers and volunteers identified.\n\nThe missing 'ghost roads', as the researchers called them, included bulldozed tracks through untouched rainforests, which represented about one-third of unmapped roads, and informal roads on palm oil plantations, which accounted for between 35 and 45 percent of newfound roads.\n\nSpeaking with Nature's Benjamin Thompson, senior study author Bill Laurance said anyone extracting natural resources such as timber, minerals or endangered wildlife could be involved in carving these illegal, illicit and informal roads through forests or already-degraded lands.\n\n\"Truth is, there's a lot of illegal activity,\" said Laurance, a conservation biologist at James Cook University in Australia. \"It's a real mixed bag, but it adds up to a lot when we put it all together.\"\n\nAlthough the study did not look at who was responsible for building these roads, it shows that official records are seriously underestimating human impact in these areas.\n\nRoad building \"almost always\" preceded forest loss, a further analysis of satellite imagery between 1985 and 2020 found. In about 92 percent of 12 focus areas studied, each about 400 square kilometers in size, the nearby forest was logged as roads were being built, or soon after they appeared.\n\nProtected areas also did little to safeguard against land clearing once those roads had been built. They contained a third as many roads as unprotected areas, but on a per-kilometer basis, roads inside protected areas led to nearly as much forest loss as roads outside them.\n\nFor protected areas to be effective safeguards they need to limit road expansion, the researchers say.\n\n\"The bottom line is, where the roads go is where the forest destruction happens. They're just hand-in-hand,\" Laurance told Thompson.\n\nFor the moment, Laurance says their team of volunteers still outperform the artificial intelligence models they tested to survey a wider area much faster than human eyes can. But that kind of automated system is urgently needed to protect tropical forests.\n\n\"Nothing else will keep pace with the contemporary avalanche of proliferating roads,\" the researchers attest.\n\nRecent studies scouring satellite imagery of the Brazilian Amazon, Cameroon, and the Solomon Islands have detected 3 to 10 times more roads than official maps suggest, suggesting we're only just scratching the surface of the ghost road problem.\n\nThe study has been published in Nature.",

        "text": "Dow Jones futures will open Sunday evening, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, following a tough market week. Earnings from Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META) and many more are on deck. Tesla, which reports Tuesday, slashed EV and FSD prices over the weekend.\n\nX\n\nThe stock market suffered sharp losses in the past week. The Dow Jones actually rose a fraction. But the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite plunged below their respective 50-day moving averages, suffering their worst week in more than a year.\n\nMost of all, leading stocks were the biggest losers. Nvidia (NVDA), the ultimate AI stock and company, dived below key support.\n\nChip and AI stocks sold off on cautious comments from ASML (ASML) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM).\n\nAI server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) crashed Friday after not releasing preliminary results, raising fears about AI demand overall.\n\nThe market environment is decidedly weak. Investors should be largely in cash, waiting for renewed signs of strength in the major indexes and leading stocks.\n\nKey Earnings Ahead\n\nMicrosoft, Meta Platforms, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) headline a huge week of earnings. General Electric (GE), ServiceNow (NOW), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Dexcom (DXCM) and Caterpillar (CAT) are among the many other notable reports on tap.\n\nGoogle stock is in a buy zone. Meta stock, Chipotle and Caterpillar could be setting up, while Dexcom has retreated slightly below a buy point. GE is greatly extended while Microsoft and ServiceNow are starting to crack. Tesla stock has plunged to 52-week lows amid a host of bad news.\n\nThese reports and guidance will have a huge impact on their sectors and overall market. Microsoft, Google, Meta and ServiceNow will offer insights into artificial intelligence, as well as cloud computing, online advertising and business software.\n\nFor Tesla, there are huge questions regarding the EV giant's growth strategy. Most of all, is Elon Musk shelving a next-generation Model 2?\n\nOn Saturday, Tesla cut Model Y, S and X prices in the U.S. by $2,000, while also cutting Full Self-Driving to $8,000 from $12,000.\n\nOn Sunday, Tesla cut China prices for the Model 3 and Y by nearly $2,000 while slashing Model S and X prices by up to 22%. Tesla also cut Model 3 prices in key European markets by roughly $2,100-$3,200.\n\nMeta stock is on IBD Leaderboard. Microsoft stock is on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list. Meta, DexCom and Google stock are on the IBD 50. Meta Platforms, Google and ServiceNow stock are on the IBD Big Cap 20.\n\nDow Jones Futures Today\n\nDow Jones futures open at 6 p.m. ET, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures.\n\nRemember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.\n\nJoin IBD experts as they analyze leading stocks and the market on IBD Live\n\nStock Market Suffers Big Losses\n\nThe stock market suffered heavy losses this past week, especially the Nasdaq and leading growth plays.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.01% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index tumbled 3.05%, its biggest weekly decline since March 2023. The Nasdaq composite plunged 5.5%, its worst week since November 2022. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 2.8%.\n\nThe market's power trend, in force since November, is over as the Nasdaq's 21-day exponential moving average undercut the 50-day line.\n\nSome stocks are holding support, with a few making encouraging moves. But generally leading stocks are looking damaged or broken.\n\nAI and chip stocks had been holding up reasonably well. But they led the downside this past week, with Nvidia and especially Super Micro plunging on Friday.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility index, or VIX, briefly spiked Friday to the market fear gauge's highest levels since late October. Meanwhile, various indicators suggest the market is significantly oversold. But it's been oversold for some time.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield jumped 11 basis points to 4.61%, hitting a five-month intraday high of nearly 4.7% on Tuesday. Markets now expect just one Fed rate cut in 2024.\n\nU.S. crude oil futures fell 2.9% to $83.14 a barrel for the week.\n\nTesla Plunges With One Big Question For The Earnings Call\n\nETFs\n\nAmong growth ETFs, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) plunged 5.1%. Microsoft is a huge IGV holding, with ServiceNow stock a key component. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) dived 9.7%. Nvidia stock is the No. 1 holding in SMH, with Taiwan Semi and ASML key members.\n\nSPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) dipped 0.8% last week. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) retreated 2.8%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) jumped 4.7%. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) skidded 3.9%.\n\nThe Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) fell 1.25% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) closed fractionally higher. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) gave up 2%, with Caterpillar and GE stock the top two holdings.\n\nThe Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) advanced 0.85% and the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) climbed 1.8%.\n\nReflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) sold off 9.6% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) 10%. Tesla stock is a huge holding across Ark Invest's ETFs.\n\nTime The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nAI Hardware Stocks Plunge\n\nAI chip and hardware stocks, the driving force of the market rally from late October to early March, were the big losers last week.\n\nASML plunged 10.6% for the week on weak Q1 sales and guidance. That also dragged down other chip-equipment makers.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor stock dived 10.4% despite beating views and guiding higher, fueled by AI chip demand. But the foundry giant was cautious about demand for chips overall.\n\nNvidia tumbled 13.6%, including Friday's 10% dive to knife through the 50-day. It's now given up over two-thirds of its gains following the fiscal Q1 earnings on Feb. 21.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM) crashed 31% for the week\n\nSMCI stock dived 20.6% for the week even with Tuesday's 10.6% spike. Shares dived 23.1% on Friday, literally on no news. Disappointing investors, Super Micro didn't give preliminary results as the AI server maker announced its upcoming Q1 earnings date. That might have also raised concerns about AI chip demand.\n\nAll of these stocks flashed sell signals.\n\nSMCI and Nvidia are the two biggest winners on the S&P 500 in 2024, but they were the S&P 500's biggest losers Friday.\n\nCatch The Next Big Winning Stock With MarketSurge\n\nWhat To Do Now\n\nThe stock market is in bad shape. The major indexes are all well below their 50-day moving averages. Nvidia and other tech standouts are no longer resisting the selling but instead starting to lead the slide.\n\nIt's not a time to be buying stocks. Investors should have slim-to-modest exposure, generally only keeping winners with a hefty cushion.\n\nThis is a time to build watchlists. You want to look for stocks finding support and showing relative strength.\n\nThere are some names holding up, including GE, Google, Meta, Chipotle, Glaukos (GKOS), Martin Marietta (MLM) and Allstate (ALL).\n\nRemember that in a downtrend, resilient stocks today may not stay that way tomorrow, as Nvidia, Super Micro and ServiceNow showed.\n\nAnd relative winners can be absolute losers.\n\nEarnings season could provide a positive catalyst for stocks. But, as investors saw this past week, they could trigger fresh selling.\n\nRead The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.\n\nPlease follow Ed Carson on Threads at @edcarson1971 and X/Twitter at @IBD_ECarson for stock market updates and more.\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:\n\nWhy This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks\n\nWant To Get Quick Profits And Avoid Big Losses?

Testers will then need to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) before gaining access. The company also encourages selected participants to use their TicWatch Pro 5 daily with the Wear OS 4 beta software installed and provide timely feedback.\n\nRelated discussions and other opinions are okay, but must take place only within designated Slack channels set up by Mobvoi for the beta program.\n\nImage: Mobvoi\n\nMobvoi’s Facebook group unfortunately was vague on the specifics of the update. But based on previous beta tests for major OS updates on older models, users generally anticipate that the Wear OS 4 update is slated to refresh its UI, improve data transfer speeds, and possibly even extend battery life.\n\nIt is also not confirmed whether the final Wear OS 4 update will become available for all TicWatch Pro 5 devices. The question of whether older Mobvoi smartwatches will receive the update (if ever) is unknown as well (and when, if in case planned).\n\nWell, at the very least, the very news of an upcoming update is already a welcome announcement for its users, who have been wondering about it since the product’s launch last year.\n\nNot a Confident Precedent\n\nImage: Mobvoi\n\nMobvoi had previously struggled with rolling out the Wear OS 3 update to its older smartwatches. Models like the TicWatch Pro 3 LTE and Pro 3 Ultra LTE faced lengthy delays, despite having similar beta test programs, with the update not arriving until nearly two years after Wear OS 3 originally launched. The company attributed the setback to challenges with reworking the devices' proprietary dual-processor architecture to be compatible with the new software.\n\nIn comparison, the TicWatch Pro 5 runs on the more modern Snapdragon W5+ Gen 1 chipset, which may streamline the Wear OS 4 update process. By initiating the beta program now, Mobvoi seems intent on avoiding a repeat of the extended wait times that frustrated many customers last cycle.\n\nFingers Crossed\n\nImage: Mobvoi\n\nWhile it's exciting news that TicWatch Pro 5 owners are finally getting the much-awaited Wear OS 4 update, the question remains: Will Mobvoi deliver the Wear OS 4 update in a timely manner this time around?

        "text": "With everything a smartphone can do these days, it is often easy to overlook one of the device’s most basic functions: voice calls. Communicating by telephone has become more complicated in a world of robocalls and automated voice trees, but your phone may already have the tools to make talking to people (or not) easier. Here are a few suggestions.\n\nQuickly contact businesses\n\nNeed to call a business that is not in your contacts list? Just search for the company online with Apple’s Siri, the Google Assistant (or its new Gemini helper) or Samsung’s Bixby. When you see the establishment listed in the search results, just tap the phone icon or telephone number to place the call — or command the virtual assistant to do it.\n\n(If sharing information with your assistant or using artificial-intelligence programs causes concern, read the software’s privacy policy to see how the company is using your data.)\n\nScreen unwanted callers\n\nDon’t waste valuable time on calls you didn’t mean to answer. On an iPhone, open the Settings app, select Phone and scroll down to turn on the Silence Unknown Callers feature. Calls from numbers that aren’t in your contacts list will now be muted and sent directly to voicemail.\n\nApple’s Live Voicemail feature in iOS 17 offers a real-time transcription of messages being recorded — and you have the option to connect with callers while they’re leaving you a message, much like how it worked in the old days with answering machines. You can also send an incoming call right to Live Voicemail by tapping the Voicemail icon on the call screen. Live Voicemail can be toggled off or on in the Phone app’s settings.\n\nAndroid-based phones have their own call-management tools, but they vary by the model and software version. To see what is available for you, open the Phone app, tap the Menu icon (the three vertical dots) in the top-right corner and select Settings.\n\nGoogle’s own Pixel phones have several useful features, like the Call Screen tool that has the Google Assistant pick up and ask who’s calling. Google’s Phone app also has a Caller ID & Spam option, which can help identify callers and block spam calls. Samsung has a similar Smart Call feature in the Phone settings for its Android-based Galaxy devices, and its Bixby assistant can answer for you with the Text Call feature.\n\nCall-screening features can be toggled off and on, for when you are expecting a call from someone not in your contacts list. And in Google’s Contacts app, you can even route calls from selected numbers directly to voicemail.\n\nHand off the hold queue\n\nApps and websites have taken over several customer-service tasks like rebooking flights, but sometimes you need to talk to a human. Many companies now use an automated callback service so you don’t have to languish on hold, but in other cases the Google Assistant may be able to wait on your behalf.\n\nHold for Me, which became available on Google’s Pixel phones in 2020, is one method. You need to enable Hold for Me in the Google Phone app’s settings first, but when you later make a call and get put on hold, tap the Hold for Me option on the phone’s screen. The Google Assistant waits and alerts you when a representative is on the line.\n\nIf you don’t have a Pixel phone, there’s the similar “Talk to a Live Representative” experiment from Google’s Search Labs. It’s available in the Google app for iOS and Android; tap the lab-flask icon in the upper-left corner to get to Search Labs. “Talk to a Live Representative” — which is live until the end of 2024 — lists the 1-800 numbers for several airlines and other businesses, and lets you request a call and calls you back when the representative is there. It’s still experimental, though, and might not work consistently.\n\nDon’t miss calls\n\nIf you need to keep your ringer silenced but don’t want to miss an important call, use a visual or vibration notification to alert you.\n\nIn iOS 17, go to the main Settings app to Accessibility and then Audio & Visual to LED Flash for Alerts. In Android 14, tap the Settings, go to Notifications and select Flash Notifications to get to the options for camera- and screen-flash alerts. You’ll see a pop of light or color when you receive a call.\n\nFlash-sensitive people should use the vibration alternative instead. In the Sound & Haptics settings on an iPhone, you can assign custom vibrations to callers. Android-powered phones, including the Pixel and Galaxy models, have their own adjustable vibration options.\n\nYou’ll likely find even more helpful tools in your phone’s settings once you start poking around. And you can enjoy the irony of using 21st-century software to assist with a communications method that has been around for 148 years as of this month.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\nGet more business news by signing up for our Economy Now newsletter.",

        "text": "Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us?\n\nThe Oura Ring is a sleek and stylish wearable device that has gained popularity based on its advanced sleep-monitoring features. It provides users with detailed insights into their sleep patterns, including the duration of each sleep stage, heart rate variability, and respiratory rate. It also tracks other key health metrics, such as body temperature and activity levels.\n\nHowever, the question remains: Can the Oura Ring track fitness metrics such as step counting? It’s time to find out.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nDoes the Oura Ring track steps?\n\nThe simple answer is this: Yes, it does! The Oura Ring tracks steps. Similar to smartwatches like the Google Pixel Watch 2 and Apple Watch Series 9, the Oura Ring can track your steps just like any other fitness tracker. This feature allows you to gauge the distance you’ve traveled and the calories you’ve burned daily.\n\nHow to track steps with the Oura Ring\n\nIt’s important to note that activity tracking is not the primary focus of the Oura Ring. Therefore, it doesn’t measure steps in the traditional sense. Instead, it relies on its built-in 3D accelerometer to track your body movement throughout the day and estimate your step count.\n\nTo find your ste- tracking information via your smartphone on the Oura app for iPhone or Android, do the following:\n\nOpen the Oura app on your phone.\n\nTap on the Activity tab\n\nHere, you can see a snapshot of of how far you’ve walked and how many steps you’ve taken.\n\nChoose Steps to see a history of your step tracking.\n\nChoose Walking Equivalency to see the history of your distance walked.\n\nAccording to Oura, the walking equivalency metric does not indicate the exact distance you have traveled, but rather, it reflects the equivalent walking distance of all your daily activities. Also, engaging in higher-intensity activities like jogging increases your daily walking distance more than low-intensity activities, such as casual walking, even if the distance covered is the same.\n\nIf you’re looking for a more precise way to track your steps, consider buying a smartwatch. The best smartwatches available today offer more advanced tools for step tracking than the current Oura Ring. For instance, the Apple Watch Series 9 has GPS, an accelerometer, and a gyroscope to track arm movements and body position during exercise.\n\nThe Oura Ring’s long list of features makes it a popular choice for anyone who wants to track things like sleep, mental health, heart rate, and more.\n\nEditors' Recommendations",

        "title": "Congressman goes back to class to understand AI",
        "text": "WASHINGTON — Don Beyer’s car dealerships were among the first in the U.S. to set up a website. As a representative, the Virginia Democrat leads a bipartisan group focused on promoting fusion energy. He reads books about geometry for fun.\n\nSo when questions about regulating artificial intelligence emerged, the 73-year-old Beyer took what for him seemed like an obvious step, enrolling at George Mason University to get a master’s degree in machine learning. In an era when lawmakers and Supreme Court justices sometimes concede they don’t understand emerging technology, Beyer’s journey is an outlier, but it highlights a broader effort by members of Congress to educate themselves about artificial intelligence as they consider laws that would shape its development.\n\nFrightening to some, thrilling to others, baffling to many: Artificial intelligence has been called a transformative technology, a threat to democracy or even an existential risk for humanity. It will fall to members of Congress to figure out how to regulate the industry in a way that encourages its potential benefits while mitigating the worst risks.\n\nBut first they have to understand what AI is, and what it isn’t.\n\n“I tend to be an AI optimist,” Beyer told The Associated Press following a recent afternoon class on George Mason’s campus in suburban Virginia. “We can’t even imagine how different our lives will be in five years, 10 years, 20 years, because of AI. … There won’t be robots with red eyes coming after us any time soon. But there are other deeper existential risks that we need to pay attention to.”\n\nRisks like massive job losses in industries made obsolete by AI, programs that retrieve biased or inaccurate results, or deepfake images, video and audio that could be leveraged for political disinformation, scams or sexual exploitation. On the other side of the equation, onerous regulations could stymie innovation, leaving the U.S. at a disadvantage as other nations look to harness the power of AI.\n\nStriking the right balance will require input not only from tech companies but also from the industry’s critics, as well as from the industries that AI may transform. While many Americans may have formed their ideas about AI from science fiction movies like “The Terminator” or “The Matrix,” it’s important that lawmakers have a clear-eyed understanding of the technology, said Rep. Jay Obernolte, R-Calif., and the chairman of the House’s AI Task Force.\n\nWhen lawmakers have questions about AI, Obernolte is one of the people they seek out. He studied engineering and applied science at the California Institute of Technology and earned an M.S. in artificial intelligence at UCLA. The California Republican also started his own video game company. Obernolte said he’s been “very pleasantly impressed” with how seriously his colleagues on both sides of the aisle are taking their responsibility to understand AI.\n\nThat shouldn’t be surprising, Obernolte said. After all, lawmakers regularly vote on bills that touch on complicated legal, financial, health and scientific subjects. If you think computers are complicated, check out the rules governing Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nKeeping up with the pace of technology has challenged Congress since the steam engine and the cotton gin transformed the nation’s industrial and agricultural sectors. Nuclear power and weaponry is another example of a highly technical subject that lawmakers have had to contend with in recent decades, according to Kenneth Lowande, a University of Michigan political scientist who has studied expertise and how it relates to policy-making in Congress.\n\nFederal lawmakers have created several offices — the Library of Congress, the Congressional Budget Office, etc. — to provide resources and specialized input when necessary. They also rely on staff with specific expertise on subject topics, including technology.\n\nThen there’s another, more informal form of education that many members of Congress receive.\n\n“They have interest groups and lobbyists banging down their door to give them briefings,” Lowande said.\n\nBeyer said he’s had a lifelong interest in computers and that when AI emerged as a topic of public interest he wanted to know more. A lot more. Almost all of his fellow students are decades younger; most don’t seem that fazed when they discover their classmate is a congressman, Beyer said.\n\nHe said the classes, which he fits in around his busy congressional schedule — are already paying off. He’s learned about the development of AI and the challenges facing the field. He said it’s helped him understand the challenges — biases, unreliable data — and the possibilities, like improved cancer diagnoses and more efficient supply chains.\n\nBeyer is also learning how to write computer code.\n\n“I’m finding that learning to code — which is thinking in this sort of mathematical, algorithmic step-by-step, is helping me think differently about a lot of other things — how you put together an office, how you work a piece of legislation,” Beyer said.\n\nWhile a computer science degree isn’t required, it’s imperative that lawmakers understand AI’s implications for the economy, national defense, health care, education, personal privacy and intellectual property rights, according to Chris Pierson, CEO of the cybersecurity firm BlackCloak.\n\n“AI is not good or bad,” said Pierson, who formerly worked in Washington for the Department of Homeland Security. “It’s how you use it.”\n\nThe work of safeguarding AI has already begun, though it’s the executive branch leading the way so far. Last month, the White House unveiled new rules that require federal agencies to show their use of AI isn’t harming the public. Under an executive order issued last year, AI developers must provide information on the safety of their products.\n\nWhen it comes to more substantive action, America is playing catchup to the European Union, which recently enacted the world’s first significant rules governing the development and use of AI. The rules prohibit some uses — routine AI-enabled facial recognition by law enforcement, for one — while requiring other programs to submit information about safety and public risks. The landmark law is expected to serve as a blueprint for other nations as they contemplate their own AI laws.\n\nAs Congress begins that process, the focus must be on “mitigating potential harm,” said Obernolte, who said he’s optimistic that lawmakers from both parties can find common ground on ways to prevent the worst AI risks.\n\n“Nothing substantive is going to get done that isn’t bipartisan,” he said.\n\nTo help guide the conversation lawmakers created a new AI task force (Obernolte is co-chairman), as well as an AI Caucus made up of lawmakers with a particular expertise or interest in the topic. They’ve invited experts to brief lawmakers on the technology and its impacts — and not just computer scientists and tech gurus either, but also representatives from different sectors that see their own risks and rewards in AI.\n\nRep. Anna Eshoo is the Democratic chairwoman of the caucus. She represents part of California’s Silicon Valley and recently introduced legislation that would require tech companies and social media platforms like Meta, Google or TikTok to identify and label AI-generated deepfakes to ensure the public isn’t misled. She said the caucus has already proved its worth as a “safe place” place where lawmakers can ask questions, share resources and begin to craft consensus.\n\n“There isn’t a bad or silly question,” she said. “You have to understand something before you can accept or reject it.”\n\nGet more business news by signing up for our Economy Now newsletter.",

        "title": "This artificially intelligent pin wants to free you from your phone",
        "text": "On a recent afternoon, I held a bagel in front of me and said: “Look and tell me if this is healthy.”\n\nA monotone voice responded that the bagel was unhealthy because it was high in carbohydrates, which could contribute to weight gain.\n\nI wasn’t talking to a tech bro obsessed with the ketogenic diet. This was the Ai Pin, a $700 tiny computer featuring a virtual assistant pulling data from OpenAI (the research firm behind the ChatGPT chatbot), Google, Microsoft and others to answer questions and perform tasks.\n\nShaped like a lapel pin that may be a throwback to “Star Trek,” it attaches to your clothing with magnets and is supposed to offload tasks you would normally do with a smartphone, like taking notes, searching the web and shooting photos. Instead of a screen, the pin shines a green laser on your hand to show text. The device includes a camera, speaker and cellular connection.\n\nThe novel design of the Ai Pin, which was made by the startup Humane, generated buzz when it was unveiled late last year. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, and companies including Microsoft and Salesforce have placed a bold bet — to the tune of $240 million in funding for Humane — that artificially intelligent hardware like the Ai Pin will become the next big thing after the smartphone. (The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft last year for using copyrighted news articles without permission to train chatbots.)\n\nHumane said its goal with the Ai Pin was to offer technology that would help people avoid screens and maintain eye contact.\n\nI liked the chic aesthetic and concept of the pin. It was occasionally helpful, like when it suggested items to pack for my recent trip to Hawaii. But as I wore it for two weeks, it presented glaring flaws. Often, its responses were off-putting, like with the bagel, or wrong, like when it said the square root of 49 was 49. Also, the Times’ photo shoot of the Ai Pin ended prematurely when the device overheated and shut down.\n\nI wouldn’t pay $700 for this pin — let alone the $24-a-month subscription required to use its data services, including its T-Mobile cellular plan. But consider my curiosity piqued.\n\nImran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, Humane’s husband-and-wife founders, who worked at Apple, said updates issued through its servers would address many of the glitches I had encountered, including heat issues and shoddy math.\n\n“It’s a journey, and we are just at the start,” Bongiorno said. “The first version is never the entirety of the vision.”\n\nHere’s how my experience wearing the Ai Pin went.\n\nGetting started\n\nSince the Ai Pin lacks a screen, users set up their accounts and other settings on Humane’s website. To unlock the device with a passcode, hold out your hand to project a green laser onto your palm. Pulling your hand outward increases the number while pulling it inward decreases it, and you select each digit by pinching two fingers on the same hand.\n\nThe laser can be used to tweak other settings, like connecting to a Wi-Fi network, and it can show a text transcription of the virtual assistant’s answers. Humane said the laser was intended to be used for no longer than nine minutes, but for me, it lasted about three before the Ai Pin complained it was too hot and shut down.\n\nA virtual assistant\n\nBeyond unlocking the pin with the laser, you’ll control the Ai Pin mostly with finger taps and your voice. The advantage of pinning a virtual assistant to my shirt became clear when I was moving around and thinking about the many things I had to do.\n\nWith one finger held down on the Ai Pin, I could summon the assistant and ask it to add tasks to my to-do list. This feature shined when I was packing for my vacation to Hawaii and adding items to my packing list, including T-shirts and swim trunks. When I asked the pin to suggest other items to pack for my trip there, it recommended a hat, sunscreen and other relevant items. Very cool.\n\nHowever, the Ai Pin was less helpful in some other situations. When I was in Hawaii last week, I struggled to remember the name of a food truck near my hotel serving loco moco, so I asked the assistant to look it up for me. It said no such food truck could be found, leading me to search on my phone instead.\n\nA language interpreter\n\nAn important feature on the Ai Pin is the ability to translate a conversation into another language in real time. With one finger held down on the pin, I could set a language to translate to, such as Mandarin. When I held two fingers down on the pin and spoke a phrase in English, the Ai Pin said it in Mandarin, and vice versa.\n\nI tested this with several other languages, including Spanish, French and Indonesian. I confirmed that the interpreter was usually correct, though with converting English into Mandarin, it incorrectly translated “good morning” into “da jia hao,” which means “hello, everyone.”\n\nWould you look at that?\n\nHumane is including a feature called Vision on the Ai Pin, which is labeled “beta” to signal that it is unfinished. The device uses its camera and AI to analyze your surroundings and give information about what you are looking at. This is what led to my quirky experience with a bagel, which only got weirder when I asked more questions.\n\nI asked the pin how to make the bagel more delicious, and it proceeded to explain how to make bagels from scratch. Eventually, I asked the pin to come up with suggestions for sandwiches that could be made with the bagel. It generated a long list of ideas, including chickpea salad sandwiches, sloppy Joes and cucumber sandwiches with green chutney.\n\nOn vacation, I visited a botanical garden and asked the pin to identify a flower. “The flower is yellow with red stripes on the inside,” the pin said. This was correct, but it didn’t answer my question.\n\n“It’s a Solandra maxima,” my wife said. She had taken a photo of the flower with her phone and uploaded it into a Google Images search. I felt sheepish.\n\nHumane said it was working constantly to improve the Vision feature.\n\nThe phone stuff\n\nSimilar to a smartphone, the Ai Pin has its own phone number and cellular data connection to place phone calls and play music, and its camera can be used to shoot photos and videos.\n\nHere is where the Ai Pin especially underdelivered. For something designed to make you spend less time on your phone, it isn’t better than a smartphone at any of those tasks. Photos and videos taken with the camera look poorly lit and blurry. To place a phone call, you can ask the assistant to call someone in your address book, but to dial a new number, you dictate the digits. For music, the device currently works only with Tidal, an unpopular music streaming service.\n\nBongiorno said the Ai Pin let her take more candid photos without a screen getting in the way. But to me, this was a disadvantage. Without a viewfinder, photos looked poorly framed.\n\nBottom line\n\nWhile the Ai Pin was occasionally useful and impressive, it was wrong, unhelpful or inefficient enough times to drive me back to my phone.\n\nGary Marcus, an AI entrepreneur, said the mistakes the Ai Pin made, like with the bagel, were the result of so-called hallucinations, the tendency for AI to guess and make things up when it can’t find the right answer. That’s a problem that remains unsolved in many AI technologies including ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.\n\nBongiorno acknowledged that hallucinations were happening with Gemini, the technology behind the Ai Pin’s Vision feature. She added that the technology would improve rapidly with user feedback and that the company had already finessed the pin’s reaction to bagels.\n\nMarcus said no company yet had AI technology that was sophisticated enough to make a virtual assistant answer questions reliably.\n\n“It’s almost like a broken watch being right twice a day,” he said. “It’s right some of the time, but you don’t know which part of the time, and that greatly diminishes its value.”\n\nYet there is a kernel of an idea worth preserving. I liked having an assistant on my shirt when it was actually helpful. I’ll pin my hopes on future iterations of the product — perhaps a cheaper one that lacks a camera and a laser.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\nGet more business news by signing up for our Economy Now newsletter.",
        "summary": "On a recent afternoon, I held a bagel in front of me and said: “Look and tell me if this is healthy.” I wasn’t talking to a tech bro obsessed with the ketogenic diet. Shaped like a lapel pin that may be a throwback to “Star Trek,” it attaches to your clothing with magnets and is supposed to offload tasks you would normally do with a smartphone, like taking notes, searching the web and shooting photos. Instead of a screen, the pin shines a green laser on your hand to show text. The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft last year for using copyrighted news articles without permission to train chatbots.) It was occasionally helpful, like when it suggested items to pack for my recent trip to Hawaii. I wouldn’t pay $700 for this pin — let alone the $24-a-month subscription required to use its data services, including its T-Mobile cellular plan. “It’s a journey, and we are just at the start,” Bongiorno said. “ The advantage of pinning a virtual assistant to my shirt became clear when I was moving around and thinking about the many things I had to do.

        "text": "India’s election overshadowed by the rise of online misinformation Greater internet penetration and the rise of \"cheapfakes\" since the last general election in 2019 pose new challenges\n\nAs India kicks off the world’s biggest election, which starts on April 19 and runs through June 1, the electoral landscape is overshadowed by misinformation.\n\nThe country — which has more than 830 million internet users and is home to the largest user base for social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram — is already at the highest risk of misinformation and disinformation, according to the World Economic Forum. AI has complicated the situation further, including deepfakes created with generative AI.\n\nMisinformation is not just a problem for election fairness — it can have deadly effects, including violence on the ground and increase hatred for minorities.\n\nPratik Sinha, the co-founder of the Indian non-profit fact-checking website Alt News, says there’s been an increase in the deliberate creation of misinformation to polarize society. “Ever since social media has been thriving, there is a new trend where you use misinformation to target communities,” he said.\n\nThe country’s vast diversity in language and culture also make it particularly hard for fact-checkers to review and filter out misleading content.\n\n“India is unusual in its size and its history of democracy,” Angie Drobnic Holan, the director of International Fact-Checking Network, told TechCrunch in an interview. “When you have got a lot of misinformation, you have a lot of need for fact-checking, and things that make the Indian environment more complex also are the many languages of India.”\n\nThe government has taken steps to address the problem, but some critics argue that enforcement is weak, and the Big Tech platforms aren’t helping enough.\n\nIn 2022, the Indian government updated its IT intermediary rules to require social media companies to remove misleading content from their platforms within 72 hours of being reported. However, the results are unclear, and some digital advocacy groups, including the Internet Freedom Foundation, have noticed selective enforcement.\n\n“You don’t want to have laws or rules that are so vague, that are so broad that they can be interpreted,” said Prateek Waghre, executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation.\n\nGoogle and Meta have made announcements about limiting misleading content on their platforms during Indian elections, and restricted their AI bots from answering election queries, but have announced no significant product-related changes or stringent actions against fake news. Moreover, just before the Indian election, Meta reportedly cut funding to news organizations for fact-checking on WhatsApp.\n\nNow fake news is proliferating on social media. Doctored videos of celebrities asking citizens to vote for a particular political party and fake news about the Model Code of Conduct applied to public programs and private chats were well spread online before the election began.\n\nHamsini Hariharan, a subject matter expert at the U.K.-based fact-checking startup Logically, told TechCrunch about the trend of “cheapfakes” — content generated with less sophisticated measures of altering images, videos, and audio — being widely shared across social media platforms in India.\n\nLast week, 11 civil society organizations in India, including the nonprofit digital rights groups Internet Freedom Foundation and Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC.in), urged the Indian election commission to hold political candidates and social media platforms accountable for any misuse.\n\nHariharan underlined that the scale and sophistication of misinformation and disinformation have drastically increased over the last five years since India’s last general election in 2019. The key reasons, she believes, are the increase in internet penetration — it’s grown from 14% in 2014 to around 50% now, according to World Bank data — and the availability of technologies to manipulate audiovisual messages, low media literacy, and the mainstream media losing some of its credibility.\n\nLogically noticed a particular spike in attempts to cast doubt about electronic voting machines. Its fact-checkers saw older claims, particularly videos and text from Supreme Court hearings about voting machines, being circulated without sufficient context. There were even some posts about these machines being banned, faulty or tempered with, along with hashtags such as #BanEVM circulated among Facebook groups with thousands of followers.\n\nSinha of Alt News agreed that misleading online content has rapidly risen in the country. He noted that social media companies are not helping to limit such content on their platforms.\n\n“Is there a single report that’s been published in four years as to how their fact-checking enterprise is doing? No, nothing, because they know it is not working. If it was working, they would have gone to town with it, but they know it’s not working,” he told TechCrunch.\n\nHolan believes there is much room for product changes that emphasize accuracy and reliability.\n\n“The platforms invested heavily during COVID in trust and safety programs. And since then, there’s clearly been a pullback,” she said.\n\nMeta and X did not answer why there have been no significant product-related updates to restrict misleading content and the amount of investments made for fact-checking in India. However, a Meta spokesperson noted the existence of a WhatsApp tip line, which was launched in late March, and an awareness campaign on Instagram to identify and stop misinformation using the platform’s built-in features.\n\n“We have a multi-pronged approach to tackling misinformation that includes building an industry-leading network of fact-checkers in the country, including training them on tackling AI-generated misinformation,” the Meta spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\nX did not answer a detailed questionnaire sent to the generic press email ID but said, “Busy now, please check back later.”",

        "title": "Google Pixel 9 and 9 Pro Rumors: New Designs, Tensor G4 and a Pixel XL",
        "text": "Google's Pixel line of flagship phones has always impressed us, with the most recent Pixel 8 and 8 Pro packing solid performance, generous software support and innovative AI-based features. But those two phones launched in October 2023, so we're already looking ahead to later in the year when we may see the Pixel 9 series.\n\nRumors are still quite patchy, but there are some key bits of information we've been able to glean about the upcoming range.\n\nWe'll be updating this story over the next several months as the Pixel 9 launch gets closer, so keep checking back.\n\nRead more: Why I Need Apple to Make a Foldable iPhone\n\nWatch this: What Google Gemini AI on the iPhone Could Look Like 08:16\n\nFall 2024 launch\n\nGoogle usually releases its new Pixel devices in October, as was the case with the Pixel 8 series and Pixel 7 series. There are currently no rumors to suggest Google is looking to radically alter its product release timeline, so it seems likely we'll be seeing the Pixel 9 series later in the year.\n\nThe Pixel 8 series' 2023 launch happened in the month of October. We'd expect a similar date for the Pixel 9. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nIn the meantime, Google I/O takes place in May, and it's possible we'll see a teaser for the upcoming range, and possibly an announcement of the more affordable Pixel 8A.\n\nThree Pixel 9 models\n\nA rumor that's persisted since Android Authority published it back in late 2022 is that there'll be three models of the Pixel 9 phone, rather than the usual two. It's expected that we'll still see a base Pixel 9, but there may now be two versions of the flagship Pro range: a large model and a smaller one.\n\nRead more: Top Phones to Expect in 2024\n\nThe smaller version will reportedly be similar in size to the base model but will include the higher-performance cameras typically seen only with the larger size. The 9 Pro XL (as it's rumored to be named) would feature the same higher-end specs but with a larger display.\n\nThis more closely mirrors Apple's strategy, which typically includes the base iPhone models, along with two Pro phones in different sizes with beefed-up cameras.\n\niPhone-like design\n\nSpeaking of the iPhone, it's possible the Pixel 9 range will get design changes that echo some of the iPhone 15's aesthetics. Renders apparently acquired by notable tipster OnLeaks and published by MySmartPrice show a Pixel 9 with flat, metal sides and a flat back panel that look similar to those seen on the most recent iPhones.\n\nThe other big physical change shown in the leaks is to the camera bar on the back. Previously, this was one solid bar that stretched the whole width of the phone, connecting to the edges on both sides. The renders suggest the camera bar will instead become an oval island that stands alone in the middle.\n\nA render purportedly of the Pixel 9. MySmartPrice/@OnLeaks\n\nWhile the rumors haven't been specific about what size displays we may see, most signs suggest the base Pixel 9 will remain around 6.1 inches, with the 9 Pro coming in at a similar size. The 9 Pro XL would be larger, measuring around 6.8 inches, in line with the sizing of the current Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nSimilar cameras\n\nFull camera specs have yet to leak, so there's little for photographers like me to get excited about just yet. However the rumors regarding a third size for the Pixel 9 family suggest that this will allow Google to bring the same triple-camera setup -- including telephoto zoom -- to the smaller Pixel 9 Pro. Currently, that's available only on the larger Pixel 8 Pro handset.\n\nThat's good news for those of you who prefer a smaller phone but still want the best features. Though whether Google takes a page from Apple's book by adding exclusive features to its largest phone remains to be seen. (The iPhone 15 Pro Max, for example, has a 5x optical zoom option that isn't available on the smaller iPhone 15 Pro.)\n\nThe Pixel 8 and 8 Pro have decent, but not top-end, performance. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nNew Tensor processor\n\nIt's pretty much a given that Google will unveil the latest generation of its homegrown processor, likely to be called the Tensor G4. Google's Tensor processors aren't top of the class in terms of raw power, but the company boasts they're particularly tuned for on-device AI. We expect that'll once again be the case for Google's next Tensor chip.\n\nAndroid 15 at launch\n\nGoogle always uses the Pixel line to show off the latest that Android has to offer, so it's safe to assume the Pixel 9 series will launch with the latest Android 15 on board. Android 15 is set to be officially unveiled at Google I/O in May, but the early developer previews show new settings for improved privacy and camera control.\n\nOne major new feature may be the addition of satellite messaging, according to Android Authority, helping the Pixel line compete with Apple's Emergency SOS features that also use satellite messaging.\n\nThe Pixel 8 line launched with Android 14 on board. The Pixel 9 will almost certainly launch with Android 15. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nBeyond that, it's safe to assume there'll be increased focus on generative AI features. We also hope to see Google continue to offer at least seven years of software support as it did with the Pixel 8. If it does, the Pixel 9 series will still be safe to use in 2031.\n\nHigher prices\n\nThere aren't any rumors about potential prices for the Pixel 9 series yet, but leaks via WinFuture suggest the upcoming Pixel 8A will be more expensive than its predecessor, at least in Europe. The Pixel 7A launched at 509 Euros (around $542), but the Pixel 8A could cost 569 Euros ($606), according to the report -- a significant year-on-year increase. A price increase for the Pixel 8A doesn't necessarily mean a more expensive Pixel 9 range, but it does suggest Google isn't shy about upping its prices.",

The major indexes have broken decisively below 50-day moving averages. More leading stocks need significant work before triggering buy signals.\n\nInvestors should be looking for strong evidence of market strength before adding exposure. However, with that being said, these five stocks, which all are showing good relative strength, should be on investors watchlists.\n\nHubSpot Stock\n\nHUBS shares fell 2.8% to 631.24 on Friday, sinking 4.8% for the week. The marketing software firm had flirted with reclaiming a 660 buy point from a flat base, but was turned back. Shares are holding the 50-day moving average.\n\nHUBS stock broke out on April 4 on a report that Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) was mulling a bid for the marketing software maker. There was some buzz about another possible suitor on April 19.\n\nHubSpot develops customer relationship management software that combines marketing, sales, customer service, content, operations and commerce in a single platform. Its system of five modules, called hubs, can be used alone or bundled together. It uses AI in its website generator, content and email writer, meta description generator and social media blog writer.\n\nHubSpot is expected to report its fiscal first-quarter earnings around May 1.

The EPS Rating for the AI play is a perfect 99.\n\nS&P 500: Allstate Stock\n\nAllstate stock advanced 2.3% on Friday, continuing to advance above an buy point. For the week, the S&P 500 stock gained 3.7% to 172.96.\n\nAllstate shares bounced from their 50-day moving average Thursday, reclaiming a 168.05 buy point from a cup base. The move Thursday broke a short downtrend. Meanwhile, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500, is at a 52-week high.\n\nAllstate was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day.\n\nThe insurance giant on Thursday estimated catastrophe losses for the month of March of $328 million, or $259 million after-tax. Total catastrophe losses for the first quarter were $731 million, pretax. Meanwhile, rate increases for Allstate brand auto insurance resulted in a premium impact of 0.9% in March and 2.4% year-to-date.\n\nAllstate also reported that rate increases for its brand homeowners insurance resulted in a premium impact of 0.7% in March and 3.4% so far this year.\n\nLast week, JPMorgan and Piper Sandler increased price targets on the S&P 500 stock to 185 and 188, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, HSBC last week upgraded Allstate to buy, from a previous hold rating, with a price target of 190, up from 158. HSBC wrote that rate increases continue to compound across personal auto and homeowners insurance in the U.S. and that decelerating inflationary trends put U.S. personal lines insurers \"in a sweet spot.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 stock has a 97 Composite Rating out of 99. Allstate also has a 91 Relative Strength Rating and an 81 EPS Rating.\n\nSea Limited Stock\n\nShares of Sea Limited fell 2.2% to 55.06 Friday but still climbed 3.3% to 55.06 on the week. The stock is bouncing off its 50-day moving average in an emerging base.\n\nInvestors could use the stock's April 10 high of 58.47 as an early entry. However, the consolidation probably needs another week or so with a buy point of 63.25, the stock's six-month high which it hit on March 14.\n\nSingapore-based e-commerce and gaming firm Sea Limited jumped Tuesday, rebounding from a recent dip to move ahead of its 21-day moving average.\n\nShares have gained nearly 40% this year after a rough 2023.\n\nA recent JPMorgan note looked at how efforts by TikTok Shop to improve take rates in Indonesia could allow Sea to do the same in the country for its Shopee e-commerce business.\n\nJPMorgan maintains an overweight rating for SE stock and a 70 price target. TikTok is a top competitor to Shopee in Indonesia.\n\nSea Limited is one of the largest internet services providers in Southeast Asia. It operates businesses in digital entertainment, e-commerce, and digital payments and financial services. The company's products include the e-commerce focused Shopee, which services Southeast Asia and Taiwan.\n\nThe company also owns digital-payments provider SeaMoney and Garena, a global online games developer.\n\nA strong earnings report in March helped push Sea stock higher.\n\nSea earnings are expected to soar in 2024.\n\nSea Limited stock has a 69 Composite Rating out of 99. The stock also has an 87 Relative Strength Rating. SE shares have a 19 EPS Rating.\n\nS&P 500: TransDigm Stock\n\nTransDigm stock fell 2.7% to 1,187.70 on the week, almost all on Friday. The S&P 500 stock has traded tightly for weeks, offering a 1,248.39 buy point. Shares are now just below the 50-day and 10-week moving average.\n\nCleveland-based TransDigm manufactures highly engineered parts and devices used in commercial and military aircraft, as well as proprietary products for defense applications. Its products include ignition systems, pumps, flight controls, cockpit displays and radio systems.\n\nIn February, TransDigm reported a 56% increase in adjusted earnings to $7.16 per share in Q1 compared to FactSet expectations of $6.41 per share. Revenue jumped 28% to $1.79 billion in Q1 while Wall Street anticipated $1.68 billion.\n\nRevenue from the commercial original equipment manufacturer (OEM) segment jumped 25% during the quarter. Commercial aftermarket sales leapt 22%. Defense revenue increased 28% for the quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 stock lifted its 2024 net sales outlook, predicting a range from $7.58 billion to $7.76 billion. That would represent a 16.4% increase at the midpoint compared to 2023.\n\nTransDigm guided 2024 adjusted EPS to $29.97-$31.73 per share, up from $25.84 per share in 2023. However, the S&P 500 play lowered its guidance by about $1.12 per share at the midpoint. That reflects about $130 million in additional interest expenses after issuing $2 billion of debt.\n\nIn 2023, TransDigm profit jumped 50% to $25.84 per share.

A decisive retaking of those levels would offer an early entry. But a decisive break lower could be a sell signal.\n\nCava stock is out of range from its February breakout at 56.34, according to MarketSurge analysis. It's also far extended from two earlier breakouts, including one from an IPO base.\n\nThe Mediterranean restaurant chain specializes in falafel bowls and pita. Cava delivered its first profit on an annual basis on 60% revenue growth in 2023, the year it went public.\n\nCava ties its rapid growth to more new and repeat customers. On top of that, Cava benefits from the broader health and wellness trend. More generally, restaurant stocks continue to act well as inflationary pressures abate.\n\nFounded in 2010, Cava remains in the early stages of expansion after its initial public offering in June. Some people call Cava the next Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which sits on the S&P 500, due to its customizable bowls and growth potential.\n\nChipotle reports first-quarter earnings and revenue late Wednesday.\n\nCava was featured in IBD's New America on March 28. CAVA stock has a perfect 99 Composite Rating.

        "title": "Rachael Ray reveals NYC horror stories — including fighting off teen mugger, biting ex’s thumb and throwing ‘his s–t’ out of window",
        "text": "She makes a mean sauce — and fights off muggers and jealous boyfriends, too.\n\nBefore she was famous, Rachael Ray was mugged — twice — by a teenage boy outside her Woodside, Queens, apartment.\n\n“He has literally a Glock in his hand and sticks it in my back, and I scream so loud. I think they heard it in Jersey … I freaked the flip out, and I think I scared him more than he scared me,” she dished to The Post after the premiere of her new A&E show, “Rachael Ray’s Meals in Minutes.”\n\n“I sprayed him in the face with Mace and he was not happy. I still feel really bad about it actually. I don’t think that child would have hurt me.”\n\n4 Ray debuted her new A&E show, “Rachael Ray’s Meals in Minutes,” on April 15, where she cooks in her personal home kitchen. YouTube Home.Made.Nation\n\nAt the time, Ray, now 55, was working at Agata and Valentina, an Italian gourmet market on the Upper East Side.\n\nThe night she was mugged, she left work around 11 p.m., and then headed to her roach-infested Queens walk-up.\n\n“There were roaches in my apartment, but I stayed because I was so worried about the dog that lived there,” she said.\n\nRay was worried about the super’s dog, Liza, who was kept chained in the laundry room.\n\nShe often brought food to the pup, who may have saved her life when the mugger returned a few days later.\n\n4 Before she was a household name, Ray lived in a walk-up apartment in Woodside, Queens. Google\n\n“The kid came back to mug me a second time because he was pissed,” Ray explained via Zoom from her apartment in the East Village.\n\n“He pushed me down this little alleyway, and Liza runs down the hall at him and she scared him away. He was petrified of the dog.”\n\nRay also had to duke it out with her jealous Brazilian boyfriend around this time.\n\n“He was very sweet, very kind, very funny, gorgeous … just not an ambitious fella. He liked weed and the sofa,” she said. “I literally opened the window and threw his s–t in the street. I just got so fed up.”\n\n4 Ray is married to lawyer and musician John Cusimano. Peter Yang\n\nBut he returned, enraged that another man had walked Ray home.\n\n“I hear what I think is thunder. It wasn’t thunder. He was pulling down the fire escape and crawling up the side of the building and he jumps through the window of my living room.\n\n“We had a real ruckus . . . I bit his thumb and the blood went all over. It was bad. I felt really terrible about it because I really loved him very much.”\n\nThere is no bad blood with her ex, said Ray, who has been married to lawyer and musician John Cusimano since 2005.\n\n“He still texts me to this day,” she said of her former flame. “He sends me occasional videos of whales and children playing and scenes from Brazil, which is very sweet. He asks about my mother and my brother and my sister. And I usually just respond politely.”\n\nAfter the boyfriend drama and the muggings, Ray hightailed it out of NYC and moved back to her native Glens Falls in upstate New York.\n\n“I bought a used Ford Ranger . . . pickup truck. I had to learn how to drive. . . . I started my life all over again, and I worked any place they would let me,” she recalled.\n\nAt one of her jobs, a specialty food market in Albany called Cowan & Lobel, Ray began teaching her “30-Minute Meals” — the rest is food history.\n\n4 The Emmy-winning talk show host said Gwyneth Paltrow was one of her celebrity guests who “got their hands dirty.” ©CBS/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nThe Emmy winner hosted her daytime talk show “Rachael Ray” from 2006 to 2023 and gushed over her celebrity guests — many of which were actually good cooks “that got their hands dirty.”\n\n“Oh, so many, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Hudson . . . really wonderful cooks . . . President Clinton, John McCain, incredible, people that, I was told and instructed by the folks that represent some of these people, ‘They’re not going to do this. They won’t do that.’ Yes they do,” she said.\n\n“I mean Gwyneth was eating out of the pan with her hand.”",

        "title": "Saturday: Hili dialogue",
        "text": "Good morning on Catur Saturday, April 20, 2024, Jewish cat shabbos and National Pineapple Upside Down Cake Day. My mom used to make these, and oy, do I love them. But I haven’t had one in years. Look at this beauty from Wikipedia!:\n\nPosting will be light today and I’m still working on my talk for Amsterdam (I spend a lot of time preparing). Bear with me; I do my best.\n\nToday’s Google Doodle (click to read) celebrates the NBA playoffs:\n\nIt’s also National Cheddar Fries Day, National Cold Brew Day, Lima Bean Respect Day (I have no respect for these odious legumes), UN Chinese Language Day, and, of course, it being April 20, it’s 420 (cannabis culture). Where did 420 come from? Wikipedia tells you:\n\nIn 1971, five high school students in San Rafael, California, used the term “4:20” in connection with a plan to search for an abandoned cannabis crop, based on a treasure map made by the grower. Calling themselves the Waldos, because their typical hang-out spot “was a wall outside the school”, the five students—Steve Capper, Dave Reddix, Jeffrey Noel, Larry Schwartz, and Mark Gravich—designated the Louis Pasteur statue on the grounds of San Rafael High School as their meeting place, and 4:20 pm as their meeting time. The Waldos referred to this plan with the phrase “4:20 Louis”. After several failed attempts to find the crop, the group eventually shortened their phrase to “4:20”, which ultimately evolved into a code-word the teens used to refer to consuming cannabis.\n\nAnd here’s the Pasteur Statue that served as the meeting place:\n\nReaders are welcome to mark notable events, births, or deaths on this day by consulting the April 20 Wikipedia page.\n\nDa Nooz:\n\n*I just checked the news from Columbia, and the protestors, previously removed, have moved back into the quads, illegally again. But the administration is doing nothing about it. They are calling for the killing of Israeli soldiers and similar acts of butchery.\n\nGood old SJP; you can always count on them to support terrorism. Colleges are turning into ideological raves rather than places of learning.\n\n*Well, Israel retaliated for the drone and missile attack from Iran, but it appears to have been a pretty tepid retaliation, which is fine with me. I’d prefer Israel to defeat Hamas than start a war with Iran.\n\nIsrael and Iran backed away from the brink Friday. After a small-scale Israeli overnight strike on Iran—a response to Iran’s far broader missile and drone assault on Israel last week—leaders in Tehran signaled it was time to de-escalate.\n\nBut while the foes appear intent for now on returning to the shadow war of covert strikes and counterstrikes that has characterized the conflict for years, the past week’s pair of direct attacks on each other’s territory have raised the stakes and increased the risks of miscalculation. Israel’s limited strike near the city of Isfahan appeared to provide an off-ramp from the recent cycle of direct conflict. No serious damage was reported, and it was played down by both sides, neither of which are seen as having an interest in going to war. Israel, which is still deeply entangled in its war against Hamas in Gaza, is also under pressure from the Biden administration to tamp down tensions. Iran, because its less capable air force and air defenses would leave it at a disadvantage in a full-scale conventional war with Israel or the U.S., also has an incentive to defuse the current crisis and return to its previous strategy that centered on asymmetrical warfare. The stand-down has stopped for now the back-and-forth strikes that the U.S., Europe and Gulf nations feared could send the region spiraling into war. Still, the attacks have raised the risk that one side or the other could miscalculate as they feel their way to the new rules of their conflict. The animosity that has driven the two countries to fight a long-running shadow war hasn’t diminished. But it will now play out in a context in which both sides have demonstrated a willingness to come out of the shadows and escalate to direct bombardment, security analysts said. “We’re in a new stage that is much more dangerous and precarious than we used to be in,” said Brig. Gen. Assaf Orion, who is a senior researcher with Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies, referring to Friday’s attack. “It’s a long game with a lot of moving parts with several frontiers.” Indeed, and Iran will, sooner or later, get nuclear weapons. Things aren’t back to where they were before. *The bills in Congress to give military help to Ukraine and Israel appear, mirabile dictu, to be on their way to being passed, and believe me, Ukraine needs the help very badly. And it was the Democrats who provided the momentum. The House took a critical step on Friday toward approving a long-stalled package of aid to Ukraine, Israel and other American allies, as Democrats supplied the crucial votes to push the legislation past Republican opposition so that it could be considered on the floor. The 316-94 vote cleared the way for the House to bring up the aid package, teeing up separate votes on Saturday on each of its parts. But passage of those measures, each attracting bipartisan support from different coalitions, was not in doubt, making Friday’s action the key indicator that the legislation is all but certain to prevail. Should that happen in votes set for Saturday afternoon, the Senate was expected to quickly pass the measure, and President Biden has said he would sign it into law. On Friday, the rule for considering the bill — historically a straight party-line vote — passed with more Democratic than Republican support, but it also won a majority of G.O.P. votes, making it clear that despite a pocket of deep resistance from the far right, there is broad bipartisan backing for the $95.3 billion package. The vote was an enormous victory in the long effort to fund to Ukraine as it battles Russian aggression, a major priority of President Biden. It was a triumph against the forces of isolationism within the G.O.P. and a major moment of consensus in a Congress that for the past year has been mostly defined by its dysfunction. But it came only after Speaker Mike Johnson put his job on the line by turning to Democrats in a significant breach of custom in the House, further imperiling his position even as he paved the way for the legislation to be voted on and approved. Zelensky will be exuberant, I expect, as he’s been begging for help for several months. And of course Israel, too, now apparently back in good graces with Biden, will also consider it a mitzvah.\n\n*Meanwhile, the fracas continues at Columbia University, despite the fact that Hamas Tent City was removed and three busloads of protestors arrested, with some students suspended (including the daughter of Ilhan Omar).\n\nThe new tents popped up — one, two, three — on Columbia’s campus. It was a defiant gesture on Thursday afternoon by student activists, who were furious about the university’s decision to call in the police to clear an encampment used to protest the Israel-Hamas war. If university officials thought that getting rid of the encampment, or arresting more than 100 protesters, would persuade students to give up, they may have been very wrong. By Thursday night, the tents had disappeared. But scores of students took over a campus lawn. Planning to stay all night, they were in a rather upbeat mood, noshing on donated pizza and snacks. An impromptu dance party had even broken out. “The police presence and the arrests do not deter us in any way,” said Layla Saliba, 24, a Palestinian-American student at the School of Social Work, at a news conference organized by Apartheid Divest, a coalition of student groups. . . .Other schools have also turned to tougher measures. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University and Brown University have recently acted against student protesters, including making arrests. And the leaders of schools like Vanderbilt and Pomona have defended suspending or expelling student protesters, saying that they are not interested in dialogue, but disruption. Alex Morey, director of campus rights advocacy for the free speech and legal defense group Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression said “there can be good reasons” for removing students if they are violating neutrally applied policies. But, she added, Columbia compromised itself when Ms. Shafik suggested to Congress, among other things, that the university may have investigated students and faculty for protected speech. “That’s very troubling,” Ms. Morey said, adding that consistently applied and viewpoint-neutral policies were the way out of this mess for Columbia and other universities. “If anything,” she added, “all of their repression towards us — it’s galvanized us. It’s moved us.”\n\nTear down those tents, President Shafik. But I am bothered by her apparent willingness to ditch the First Amendment by prohibiting certain forms of hate speech.\n\n*As always, I’ll steal three items from Nellie Bowles’s incomparable weekly news summary at The Free Press, called this week, “WWIII may come tomorrow. But.”\n\n→ Biden continues paying off successful young voters: Sorry, I mean “forgiving student debt.” Biden this week paid off another $7.4 billion in student loans, making his total student loan cancellation something like $153 billion. And by cancellation, I mean tax dollars were used to make the ledger go to zero. How much exactly? From Penn Wharton’s analysis: “We estimate that President Biden’s recently announced ‘New Plans’ to provide relief to student borrowers will cost $84 billion, in addition to the $475 billion that we previously estimated for President Biden’s SAVE plan.” But that goes to really needy people, right? Well, actually, at least 750,000 of those households are “making over $312,000 in average household income.” Meanwhile, to anyone who questions this allocation of resources, the White House answer is to shame them from official White House accounts by listing how much in pandemic loans were forgiven for House Republicans who own individual small business, which is weird because the reason businesses needed pandemic relief was because the White House banned them from operating. It’s a trap! And the only answer is to pay off every Media Studies PhD student’s loan. Colleges, for their part, are now charging up to $100,000 a year. Yes, literally. And since that’s ultimately going to be paid for by the taxpayers, why work to make it less expensive? Why cut corners when you need to remodel the cafeteria? → “Alleged threats”: An activist in Bakersfield, CA, named Riddhi Patel, 28, threatened the city council when it installed metal detectors at City Hall and refused to back a cease-fire resolution. She said: “I hope one day somebody brings the guillotine and kills all of you motherfuckers. . . . You guys want to criminalize us with metal detectors? We’ll see you at your house. We’ll murder you.” Thoughtful stuff. Real reaching across the aisle rhetoric here. She worked at the Center on Race, Poverty & the Environment. Perfect. But it turns out you can’t actually tell someone you’re going to murder them, specifically. As soon as she was done speaking, she was arrested, in one of the more dramatic videos of the week. She now faces 18 felony counts for what the LA Times refers to as “alleged threats.” → Men, if you want that job, simply re-identify as gender-fluid: At the University of Waterloo in Canada, there are certain professorships you can apply for only if you meet a very unique set of requirements. Mostly sexual. From the job posting for a position in the mathematics department: “eligible candidates for this search are required to identify as a woman or gender minority, which is defined to include individuals who self-identify as women, transgender, gender-fluid, nonbinary, and Two-Spirit people.” One computer science professor position must be filled by another sexually open-minded candidate; another must be filled by “a member of a racialized minority.” Is this ridiculous? Of course it is. Is it the end of civilization? Probably. But until then, men, put on some nail polish and call yourself gender-fluid. Have a single night of transgressive sex you’re not at all interested in, but do it, because then you can get back to computational theory. Okay? Is that so hard? Pierce one ear. Now you can teach physics.\n\n*A while back Texas banned all DEI initiatives in higher education, and it’s having an effect, at least jobwise.\n\nA ban on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in higher education has led to more than 100 job cuts across university campuses in Texas, a hit echoed or anticipated in numerous other states where lawmakers are rolling out similar policies during an important election year. Universities throughout Texas rushed to make changes after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed the law last year. On April 2, the president of the 52,000-student University of Texas at Austin — one of the largest college campuses in the U.S. — sent an email saying the school was shuttering the Division of Campus and Community Engagement and eliminating jobs in order to comply with the ban, which went into effect on Jan. 1. More than 60 University of Texas at Austin staff members were terminated as a result of the law, according to the Texas Conference of the American Association of University Professors. The group said it compiled the list based on affected employees who had reached out and that the number could be greater. University officials declined to confirm the number of positions eliminated. Officials at other schools, in response to inquiries from The Associated Press, indicated that a total of 36 positions were eliminated between Texas A&M University in College Station; Texas Tech University in Lubbock; Texas State University in San Marcos; The University of Houston; Sam Houston State University in Huntsville; and Sul Ross State University in Alpine. Officials said no one was let go; people were assigned to new jobs, some resigned and vacant positions were closed. Earlier this week, University of Texas at Dallas officials announced that approximately 20 associate jobs would be eliminated in compliance with the law. University officials declined to comment on how many of those positions are currently filled. Texas House of Representatives Speaker Dade Phelan, a Republican, applauded the University of Texas actions in a post on the social media platform X. “It is a victory for common sense and proof that the Legislature’s actions are working,” Phelan wrote. Texas is among five states that have recently passed legislation targeting DEI programs. At least 20 others are considering it.\n\nThis is all to the good; DEI is divisive, stifles speech, makes people pledge fealty to preferred ideologies, and has led to an increase in antisemitsm by considering Jews to be “white adjacent” as well as colonialists. Schools can have people who police bigotry and ensure all community members are treated equally, but that’s not what DEI does.\n\nMeanwhile in Dobrzyn, Hili and Szaron need OUT!:\n\nSzaron: The window seems to be open but I can’t go out. Hili: Call the servants.\n\nIn Polish:\n\nSzaron: Okno niby otwarte, a wyjść nie można. Hili: Zawołaj służbę.\n\n*******************\n\nFrom Not Another Science Cat Page:\n\nTrapped!

        "title": "If AI uses a lot of energy and you care about the climate, should you be anti-AI?",
        "text": "Artificial intelligence consumes an inordinate amount of energy, but voluntary restraint is hardly a solution to preserve the environment. AI can be used instead to find technological solutions. Alessio Terzi writes that rather than opting for outright bans on the construction of new data centres, clear incentive structures should be put in place to steer AI innovation towards solutions that are both sustainable and commercially viable.\n\nThe techno-optimism surrounding the surge of artificial intelligence (AI) is palpable. Enter, however, a classroom of sustainability master’s students, as I regularly do, and you will hear voices of complaint against what is perceived as a massively energy-intensive Silicon Valley toy with limited tangible upside for humanity’s pressing social and environmental challenges. Recent reports that data centres could consume as much electricity as Japan by 2026, and globally could require as much as half of the UK’s fresh water use by 2027, lend evidence to this concern. Consequently, several jurisdictions are considering curbs on new server farms, including Germany, China, Ireland and Singapore. A former French minister went as far as suggesting rationing access to the internet. If you care about climate action, should you be anti-AI?\n\nTwo considerations could help answer this question. First, it is important to recognise that the real promise of AI, as a general-purpose technology, lies not in offering an immediate fix to all our predicaments but in accelerating technological progress, including in the realm of environmental sustainability. In the context of climate mitigation, the early applications of AI have already begun to demonstrate its potential. For instance, making air travel more fuel-efficient, developing faster electric batteries, or helping reduce the reliance on critical raw materials, essential for the green transition but often associated with significant environmental and ethical concerns. Recently, AI helped solve a crucial hurdle related to plasma containment, representing an important step in the long road towards safe fusion energy use.\n\nAI could help with climate adaptation too. Consider the fact that the spread of zoonotic diseases is a crucial risk stemming from climate change, and that AI is being deployed to accelerate the development of vaccines. Or that extreme weather events will become more frequent, with AI helping improve weather forecasting allowing life-saving early warnings.\n\nThe second fundamental consideration relates to energy use. Many national decarbonisation strategies include plans to reduce energy consumption. However, as I’ve argued in a recent paper with energy economist Roger Fouquet, energy sobriety was always going to play a junior role in decarbonisation strategies vis-à-vis the imperative to foster innovation. If history is of any guidance, it is worth noting that declines in energy consumption are very uncommon, short-lived, and rarely happen by design. In line with this reality, the International Energy Agency expects sobriety to contribute just eight per cent to CO 2 reductions in its roadmap towards net zero by 2050. Innovation offers the only credible pathway to permanently decoupling economic activity from climate change and environmental degradation. When assessing the trade-offs between a short-term increase in energy use of AI and a medium-term boost in innovation, this element should be taken into account.\n\nWe are in the early stages of the AI revolution, implying that the technology is still being fine-tuned. If clear incentives are set right now, innovation will be designed also to maximise energy efficiency, prioritise more efficient models, or minimise cooling needs. Indeed, while a command on OpenAI’s ChatGPT requires ten times the electricity of a Google search, it has been shown that it is possible to build a large language model similar to ChatGPT-3 with much lower emissions.\n\nWhich brings us to the importance of regulation. Rather than opting for outright bans to the construction of data centres, clear incentive structures should be put in place to steer AI innovation towards solutions that are not only commercially viable but also aligned with sustainability. This could start with clear environmental reporting requirements for AI companies and could extend all the way to legislation requiring only renewable energy sources be used for new data centres. Aware of the problem, tech behemoths are turning to AI itself also to improve the efficiency of their data centres, or pledging to make them carbon neutral by 2030. To do so, tech companies are developing strategic partnerships with energy companies, be they nuclear, geothermal, solar and batteries. But voluntary measures should be complemented by regulation. Something both the US and the EU are considering in recent bills.\n\nElectrification was always expected to be a crucial component of the green transition, and therefore demand for electricity was inevitably set to increase as fossil fuels get progressively phased out. But part of the current predicament originates from the fact that it can take as little as one year to build a data centre, and up to five years to build renewable energy facilities. This mismatch is aggravating the climate cost of AI, and in most cases is the result of poor regulation.\n\nFrom a climate perspective, AI should neither be glorified nor vilified. Alone it cannot install the necessary solar and wind capacities, promote a circular economy, or restore degraded ecosystems and biodiversity. These challenges require action by consumers, businesses and governments navigating trade-offs between living standards, energy security and sustainability. But AI can augment human ingenuity in finding a solution to these wicked problems.",

        "text": "Kerry Wan/ZDNET\n\nAfter a trailblazing five-year run in the foldable market, Samsung in 2024 finds itself potentially losing its place on the leaderboard to the likes of Huawei, Honor, Motorola, and others, reports Display Supply Chain (DSCC) of Counterpoint Research.\n\nBesides lower-than-expected sales numbers of the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5, I gave last year's \"Best Foldable Phone\" honor to the OnePlus Open, which delivered a better multitasking experience, form factor, and camera performance than Samsung -- all while undercutting the Z Fold 5 by $100.\n\nAlso: iPhone 16: Three changes I want to see on the next Apple handsets\n\nWith the Galaxy Z Fold 6 expected to launch as early as this summer, here are three features that could bring Samsung back to its former glory and keep its competitors fighting for second.\n\n1. Built-in S Pen\n\nJason Hiner/ZDNET\n\nThe biggest selling point of large format foldables has been the increased screen real estate, whether the end user leverages that for consuming content, multitasking with floating windows, or taking notes. Paired with a stylus, you've got the most futuristic version of a notebook and pencil. It just makes sense.\n\nGood news: Samsung shares that vision and has made progress in creating an S Pen-supported case for the Z Fold line over the years. Bad news: Requiring an additional case -- no matter how much slimmer it's gotten -- to have an always-ready stylus is still too bulky, cumbersome, and pricey to use with a device that's already more complex than traditional smartphones.\n\nAlso: I tried a rollable phone for the first time, and it made even my foldable feel outdated\n\nThough it's easier said than done, Samsung should embed its S Pen stylus into the Galaxy Z Fold 6, similar to how it's been done with the Galaxy Note line since 2011. This one feature alone would separate the Galaxy from the rest of the foldables on the market while making the transition for Galaxy S Ultra users -- who I'd assume share similar power needs as Z Fold users -- much more welcoming.\n\n2. Wider and lighter form factor\n\nThe Google Pixel Fold (left), OnePlus Open (middle), and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 (right). Kerry Wan/ZDNET\n\nOne of the reasons why I prefer the OnePlus Open over the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 is the difference in form factor. The OnePlus has a wider external screen that -- when folded -- feels more like I'm using a traditional phone. It's also lighter than the Galaxy at 245 grams versus 253. Together, the reachability of the OnePlus Open, especially when used with one hand, makes the Galaxy Z Fold 5 feel like an ergonomic nightmare.\n\nAlso: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 leak reveals two design upgrades that'll make Google and OnePlus sweat\n\nWith the next model, I'd like to see Samsung experiment with newer aspect ratios, preferably wider and shorter ones that make using the phone require fewer finger gymnastics. I shouldn't have to stretch my thumb like I'm trying to elongate it in order to reach the logo of a webpage. Having a shorter display also means horizontal videos appear less cropped, with smaller letterboxing (black bars that fill in any gaps on the screen).\n\n3. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Lite\n\nKerry Wan/ZDNET\n\nFor a twist, Samsung should release a \"Lite\" version of the Galaxy Z Fold 6, putting aside features like a telephoto lens, wireless charging, and under-display camera (which I've almost forgotten about); using an older but still competent chipset; maybe even reserving the built-in S Pen for the regular model; and selling it at a fraction of the cost.\n\nI'm not asking for anything less than $1,000; the Galaxy Z Flip fills that gap, but somewhere around $1,200, nearing the price of the more regular Galaxy S24 Ultra, would make the foldable a more enticing buy.",

        "text": "While I like Google’s particular brand of whimsy, the Messages app should really add an in-app setting to turn off its animations and other expressive effects.\n\nGoogle’s support article points you to a system/Android-level setting to “turn off animated reactions,” but that applies to everything on your phone:\n\nOn your device, open the Settings app. Select Accessibility > Color and motion. Turn on Remove animations.\n\nThat’s too extreme for most people with an in-Google Messages preference needed instead. The demand for a high-level setting strategy in earnest with the launch of Reaction Effects. For example, reacting to a message with 👍 results in “an animated trio of hands dances around the message bubble.” You get similar animations with ❤️ 😂 😮 😡 👎 💩 🎉 😠 😢.\n\nReplying to a message with a quick thumbs up reaction is really common in this day and age. It happens so often that the Reaction Effect for it gets tedious. The fact that the animation is a tiny bit too long doesn’t help.\n\nThe counter example of an effect that’s executed well and in moderation is Animated Emoji. The fact that the motion happens in a small area is its saving grace, while the wide number of options helps.\n\nIf you think Reaction Effects are too much/long, Screen Effects take it to a whole other level. The fullscreen takeover feels intrusive. It’s fun the first few times it happens, but you can in fact go overboard with whimsy.\n\nThis is before realizing that Google has only widely launched two of the effects, with “15+” teased at launch.\n\n“I love you” : An outpouring of hearts and a bird flying across your screen for good measure\n\n: An outpouring of hearts and a bird flying across your screen for good measure “Sounds good”: Various thumb ups from the left and right edges of the screen\n\nMaybe there’s a clever way to limit how often it happens per day per conversation, but until then a setting is needed. One idea that comes to mind is letting the sender decide if they want to append an effect when they send their message. It’s a bit like Voice Moods where you choose whether to attach a mood after you record the message.\n\n(Speaking of that expressive feature, I’d like to once again point out that Google has not yet rolled out the voice recorder redesign to the beta channel. Yet, for some reason, that revamp sans Voice Moods is already available on the stable channel for several phones we checked.)",

        "title": "4 Ways to Use ChatGPT API in Python",
        "text": "In this tutorial, we will explain how to use ChatGPT API in Python, along with examples.\n\nSteps to Access ChatGPT API\n\nPlease follow the steps below to access the ChatGPT API.\n\nVisit the OpenAI Platform and sign up using your Google, Microsoft or Apple account. After creating your account, the next step is to generate a secret API key to access the API. The API key looks like this - sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx If your phone number has not been associated with any other OpenAI account previously, you may get free credits to test the API. Otherwise you have to add atleast 5 dollars into your account and charges will be based on the usage and the type of model you use. Check out the pricing details in the OpenAI website. Now you can call the API using the code below.\n\nPython Code to Access ChatGPT API\n\nStep 1 : To install the OpenAI Python library, run this command : pip install openai\n\nStep 2 : Enter your API key in os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = and input the question you would like to ask in the prompt argument in the code below.\n\nimport os import openai # Set API Key os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" openai.api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") def chatGPT(prompt, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature = 0.7, top_p=1): error_message = \"\" try: response = openai.ChatCompletion.create( model = model, messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}], temperature = temperature, top_p = top_p ) except Exception as e: error_message = str(e) if error_message: return \"An error occurred: {}\".format(error_message) else: return response['choices'][0]['message']['content'] # Run Function print(chatGPT(\"efficient way to remove duplicates in python. Less verbose response.\"))\n\nIn the model argument, you can enter either gpt-3.5-turbo , gpt-4-turbo or gpt-4 , pointing to their respective latest model version.\n\nCustom Instructions for ChatGPT\n\nSometimes you want ChatGPT to consider some high-level instructions while providing responses. In simple words, what do you want ChatGPT to know about you to provide responses. For example, you want the model to \"act like a linguistic expert and provide responses in layman's terms\". You can input instructions in the system_instruction argument in the code below.\n\n# System Message def chatGPT(prompt, system_instruction=None, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature = 0.7, top_p=1): error_message = \"\" try: messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}] if system_instruction: messages.insert(0, {'role': 'system', 'content': system_instruction}) response = openai.ChatCompletion.create( model = model, messages = messages, temperature = temperature, top_p = top_p ) except Exception as e: error_message = str(e) if error_message: return \"An error occurred: {}\".format(error_message) else: return response['choices'][0]['message']['content'] # Run Function print(chatGPT(prompt = \"who are you and what do you do?\", system_instruction = \"You are Janie Jones, the CEO of Jones Auto.\"))\n\nHow to Converse Like ChatGPT Website\n\nThe ChatGPT website remembers prior conversations while providing responses of the current question. For example : You ask '2+2', it answers '4'. Then you ask follow-up questions like \"square of it\", it returns '16'. So it remembers the prior response of '2+2'.\n\nBy default, the ChatGPT API does not remember prior conversations. However, we can make the ChatGPT API remember prior conversations by feeding it the previous questions and responses in each API request.\n\n# ChatGPT Chat import os import openai os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = \"sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" openai.api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") chatHistory = [] def chatGPT_chat(prompt, modelName=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature=0.7, top_p=1): params = { \"model\": modelName, \"temperature\": temperature, \"top_p\": top_p } chatHistory.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}) response = openai.ChatCompletion.create( **params, messages=chatHistory ) answer = response[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"].strip() chatHistory.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": answer}) return answer chatGPT_chat(\"2*3\") # 6 chatGPT_chat(\"square of it\") # The square of 6 is 36. chatGPT_chat(\"add 3 to it\") # Adding 3 to 36, we get 39.\n\nHow to Build Chatbot using ChatGPT API\n\nIn the following code, we are building an application using tkinter python library that creates a graphical user interface (GUI). It includes several widgets such as text boxes, buttons, dropdowns etc.\n\nTo install the tkinter library, run this command : pip install tkinter .\n\nimport os import openai import tkinter as tk # Set API Key os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" openai.api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") def chatGPT(prompt, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", temperature = 0.7, top_p=1): error_message = \"\" try: response = openai.ChatCompletion.create( model = model, messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}], temperature = temperature, top_p = top_p ) except Exception as e: error_message = str(e) if error_message: return \"An error occurred: {}\".format(error_message) else: return response['choices'][0]['message']['content'] # tikinter GUI Application def chatgpt_output(): input_text = input_field.get() model_name = dropdown_var.get() response = chatGPT(input_text, model_name) output_field.config(state='normal') output_field.delete(1.0, tk.END) output_field.insert(tk.END, response) output_field.config(state='disabled') # Define the function to get the selected option def on_select(value): print(\"Selected model:\", value) # Create the main window root = tk.Tk() root.title(\"ChatGPT\") root.geometry(\"600x700\") options = [\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", \"gpt-4\", \"gpt-4-turbo\"] # Create a label label = tk.Label(root, text=\"Select Model:\", font=(\"Arial\", 12, \"italic\")) label.pack() # Create dropdown menu dropdown_var = tk.StringVar(root) dropdown_var.set(options[0]) dropdown_font = ('Arial', 12) dropdown = tk.OptionMenu(root, dropdown_var, *options, command=on_select) dropdown.config(font=dropdown_font) dropdown.pack() # Create a label for the input field input_label = tk.Label(root, text=\"Enter Your Prompt:\", font=(\"Arial\", 14, \"italic\")) input_label.pack(pady=5) # Create input field input_field = tk.Entry(root, font=(\"Arial\", 14), width=50, bd=2, relief=\"groove\", justify=\"left\") input_field.pack(pady=5, ipady=15) # Create submit button submit_button = tk.Button(root, text=\"Submit\", font=(\"Arial\", 14), command=chatgpt_output) submit_button.pack(pady=10) # Create output box output_field = tk.Text(root, font=(\"Arial\", 14), state='disabled') output_field.pack(pady=10) # Start root.mainloop()\n\nHow to Improve Chatbot's look?\n\nThe GUI developed using the tkinter library lacks fancy visuals.
